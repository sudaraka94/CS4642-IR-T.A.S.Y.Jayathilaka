  "description": "Three years after opening Asylum has upped its food and service game",
  "reviews": "It's been more than\u00a0three years since Asylum opened, and at the time we rated it as rather mediocre. Since then we've\u00a0heard great things about the food, and so went in to see if the fare had improved.\nTL;DR: the food has\u00a0vastly improved.\nThe Mediterranean Chicken Salad (Rs. 800) came first.\nThe chicken was interestingly prepared, in two big pieces instead of being cut up into little ones. it was definitely juicier as a result, which we really liked. The salad leaves were fresh and sun-dried tomatoes are always a nice touch.\nNext up, the Barramundi (Rs. 1900) was dee-vine. The jalape\u00f1o sauce gave it a subtle, tangy dose\u00a0of spice.\u00a0The tahini and chick peas added\u00a0texture to the soft fish.\u00a0The color scheme in the presentation made me want to go nuts on my Instagram feed with it, but I\u00a0resisted.\nI looved the Chimichuri Lamb Ribs (Rs. 3100), but yes it was also a tad on the fatty side. I love fatty lamb though, maybe you don't. It came with risotto, which was\u00a0good too.\u00a0Not too creamy.\u00a0Clever move,\u00a0holding back on the grease, this is all too often not the case. The vegetables were not too soft, not too hard.\u00a0Perfect texture.\nThe Coconut Lime Cheesecake (Rs. 900) was, and perhaps you're sensing a theme here, really good. The mango sauce perfectly complemented\u00a0the bite of the lime, and the coconut rode in as aftertaste. The only disappointing thing was the strawberry. This dish didn\u2019t need more sour, some sweet berries would have been much better.\nThe ambience doesn\u2019t excite you, but it has a subdued charm, really private and secluded. And the AC is on maxxa chill, making it cold inside on a hot Colombo day. We almost found ourselves wishing for sweaters.\nNot bad but could be better. We weren't offered any water, and our plates were taken away before we could completely finish licking the barramundi off them. I mean who does that?\nWe tried a\u00a0perfectly chilled\u00a0Prosecco (Rs. 1050), which was honestly the best Prosecco I've ever had.\u00a0The color reminded me of\u00a0the sunset\u00a0that time I\u00a0was\u00a0driving my Alfa Romeo Spider in the North of Italy. Besides that\u00a0we didn't try any of the drinks. But\nlast time, and from what we can gather they are still quite good.\nAsylum has seriously upped its food game, though some service quirks still need to be fixed. Definitely look to spend around 7k for two people, more if you're having drinks.\nWe went back after three years to find out if Asylum has upped its food game. It has.\nAsylum is the new the bar/restaurant at the Arcade Independence Square. They've got good drinks, great ambience and decent food, but their service is still not quite up to scratch, so go with time to spare.\n",
