  "reviews": "When I was just a kid, I used to look forward to the food that my father would bring home some nights on his way back from work. One night, he brought home a submarine. It was the first submarine I ever had and it was from Acropol. It was also the first doner grill that I ever saw, at the old location on Duplication Road.\nThese days, Acropol is on Galle Road and I only go by if I'm drunk or have the munchies. They're pretty reliable, for those purposes, as they're open till midnight. I took Aisha along for an early dinner and we stuffed our faces.\nThe menu at Acropol has their specialties like shawarma, submarines and kebabs, but there's also rice options, naan and Indian curries available. If you're taking the shawarma route, you have the option of an open shawarma plate or a wrap, which is cool.\nWe asked them to give us their best shawarma and they insisted it was the Chicken and Cheese Shawarma (Rs 430). I don't really agree with them\u00a0on this, as I've tried the other shawarmas and they're better. This one has french fries inside, which is a bit weird. That's usually something you do at your own will. Still, it's a filling shawarma.\nFor kebabs, we tried the Lamb Kebab (Rs 460) and it was pretty good. What was disappointing was that the char on the outside was a bit too dry and didn't add much in terms of flavour. Inside, though, the meat was juicy and the flavour of the meat itself shone through. They really could do much more with this\u00a0though. It comes with some pita bread that seems store-bought, fries and too few pickles.\nThen we had a burger. The Beef, Cheese and Egg Burger (Rs 460) at Acropol is one of my favourite burgers in Colombo. Why? Because it's not super expensive, yet it's got a flavourful, juicy patty. The egg is fried but not overdone, so it's still runny and the yolk runs about making every bite taste rich. The cheese is nothing remarkable, but it definitely does help complete the bite. If this had a layer of pickles going on, it would be amaze. Try this when you're sloshed as it's particularly good as a post-drinks meal.\nHaving stuffed our faces, we had no room in our stomachs to try the Falafel Sandwich (Rs 290) that we bought. So I got them to pack it and fed it to a starving artist who didn't mind it. If you want a good falafel wrap, hit up Saffron at Good Market. Theirs is best.\nOh, and we washed down all this food with an Iced Milo (Rs 230). Theirs has a very\u00a0milky taste going on, pretty much tasting of milk powder with a hint of Milo. Aisha prefers this to the classic from\n. Blasphemy.\nAcropol can probably seat about 20 people in their space, but\u00a0it would feel pretty cramped. It's definitely not a dine-in destination, but the kind of place you just walk in when you happen to be passing by. Service is slow and the staff takes quite a while to get your food to you, which is unfortunate. We got our food half an hour after ordering, and it all came in one go. The waiters don't know too much about the menu, so you either go with your gut or ask the manager.\nWhile Acropol will always have a place in my heart for sheer nostalgia, it's not doing too bad for itself. It can't compete with the likes of\nin terms of quality and their prices aren't significantly lower to choose one over the other for value for money. Try the Beef, Cheese and Egg Burger on a night out.\nOkay shawarmas and surprisingly good burgers.\nAcropol Restaurant which formerly resided on R.A De Mel Mawatha has moved to a new location on Galle Road, Colombo 03. If you're a fan of shawarmas it's worth a visit.\nAcropol is personally one of my favourite junk food hangouts in the city. This little restaurant is located on the left side at the start of Duplication Road (R A De Mel Mawatha). As you walk in you will usually find the chef seamlessly carving away at a cut of meat, it\u2019s a good place to go if you\u2019re craving a kebab or a shawarma.\n\n\u0d87\u0d9a\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0ddd\u0db4\u0ddc\u0dbd\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0db4\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0db8 \u0dbb\u0dd9\u0dc3\u0dca\u0da7\u0ddd\u0dbb\u0db1\u0dca\u0da7\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db1\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dd9\u0dba\u0dd2. \u0d92 \u0dc0\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0da7 \u0dc3\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca\u200d\u0dba\u0dba\u0da7 \u0dc0\u0da9\u0dcf \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3\u0dba\u0dd2.\n\n\u0d87\u0d9a\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0ddc\u0db4\u0ddc\u0dbd\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda \u0db8\u0d9c\u0dda \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dad\u0db8 \u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dab\u0dd2\u0d9a \u0d86\u0dc4\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dc4\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca. \u0d92 \u0db4\u0dd4\u0d82\u0da0\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0da9\u0dba \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dc4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dcf \u0dad\u0dd2\u0db6\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda \u0da9\u0dd4\u0db4\u0dca\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dda\u0dc2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dbb\u0ddd\u0da9\u0dca \u0dc4\u0dd9\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca \u0d86\u0dbb\u0dca. \u0d92. \u0daf \u0db8\u0dd0\u0dbd\u0dca \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0dad \u0d86\u0dbb\u0db8\u0dca\u0db7 \u0dc0\u0db1 \u0dc3\u0dca\u0dae\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dba\u0dda \u0dc0\u0db8\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad\u0dda. \u0d87\u0dad\u0dd4\u0dc5\u0dad\u0da7 \u0dba\u0db1\u0d9a\u0ddc\u0da7 \u0db8 \u0d94\u0db6\u0da7 \u0daf\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0dbd\u0dd0\u0db6\u0dda\u0dc0\u0dd2 \u0da0\u0dd9\u0dc6\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dba\u0dcf \u0d85\u0dad\u0ddc\u0dbb\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db1\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dc0 \u0db8\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dad\u0dd3\u0dbb\u0dd4 \u0d9a\u0db4\u0db8\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dd2\u0db1 \u0d86\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dba. \u0d9a\u0dd9\u0db6\u0dcf\u0db6\u0dca \u200d\u0dc4\u0ddd \u0dc2\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dca\u0db8\u0dcf \u0d9a\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0dad\u0daf \u0db6\u0da9\u0d9c\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca \u0daf\u0dd0\u0db1\u0dda \u0d91\u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1 \u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca.\n",
