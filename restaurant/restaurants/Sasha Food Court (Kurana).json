  "reviews": "It's like a family tradition.\u00a0No ride to the airport, aachchi's place or a\u00a0holiday destination up North is complete without a\u00a0halt at Sasha Food Court.\nApart from the naans, there's nothing fantastic about this place but the handy location, big\u00a0car park, decent food\u00a0and efficient service\u00a0make it a restorative stop on a road trip.\nFresh juices, teas, coffees, rice,\u00a0sandwiches, pastries, naans, koththus, pizzas, pastas, Chinese food, sweets, Sasha Food Court caters to all needs and budgets.\nLast time we stopped by, we tried their Chicken Biryani (Rs. 520). It was a decent biryani showcasing a lot of different flavours and spices. The basmati rice was well cooked and\u00a0was soft, and\u00a0aromatic. The fried chicken leg on the other hand was a bit dry and not that crunchy. Same goes for the deep-fried egg.\u00a0The piece of roasted pineapple and the\u00a0mango chutney added an unusual but\u00a0interesting sweet touch\u00a0to the dish and the cucumber salad was a good\u00a0addition to cool down and refresh our palate.\nWe\u00a0shared another classic, the Lamprais (spelled Lump Rice at the shop)\u00a0at Rs. 480. The banana leaf\u00a0held a substantial amount of fiery and fragrant samba rice, a piece of chicken (that I assume was tasty as my partners in crime on that\u00a0day didn't even let me a bite of it), a deep-fried egg, one tasty\u00a0cutlet we\u00a0fought for, brinjal, seeni sambol and\u00a0some sort of spicy chutney. I'm no lamprais expert so I won't be able to rate the authenticity of the dish but I thought all the elements\u00a0worked well together.\nWe were pleasantly surprised with the Chicken Noodles (Rs. 620). For some obscure reason, noodle\u00a0dishes\u00a0tend to be on the boring side of the food chain. Subtlety spiced with chili and flavoured with tender chicken,\u00a0fried curry leaves and vegetables,\u00a0these noodles\u00a0defied our expectations.\nLast but not least, the Garlic Naans (Rs.120 each), that, given the\u00a0size of it,\u00a0they should seriously consider renaming\u00a0garlic pizzas.\u00a0Cooked on order, they always come fresh out of the traditional naan oven. Nicely buttery and super garlicky, they're a treat.\nThe other day, we paired it with Butter Chicken (Rs. 200), which is probably not the best option. Nothing bad about it but nothing crazy\u00a0either. The consistency of the gravy was OK but the taste lacked character. I ended up having my giant garlic naan by itself, which I didn't really mind anyway.\nWe washed everything off with a rich and spicy\u00a0Masala Tea, priced at Rs. 80 a cup. Deliciously creamy\u00a0and featuring strong notes of cinnamon and cardamom, you're in for a hearty cuppa.\nAs stated in the restaurant name itself, Sasha\u00a0is a food court and as such it isn't\u00a0what I'd describe as a glamourous place but again, as a pit stop, it\u00a0has everything you could wish for: big car park, clean bathroom and even a\u00a0playground for kids at the back.\nService is super efficient,\u00a0you won't wait for long to be served. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and portion\u00a0sizes.\nSasha Food Court is a convenient eatery when you're\u00a0in the area and feeling peckish. Stop for a naan, a masala tea or a fresh juice and hit the road again.\n",
