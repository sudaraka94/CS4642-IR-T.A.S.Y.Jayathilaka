  "reviews": "Located a few blocks away from Carey College, Tropical Fresh opened up a few months ago. While they serve a delicious fruit juice, unfortunately, that is the only good thing about that place.\nWe started off with a\u00a0Mango Juice (Rs. 200). It was absolutely delicious. The texture was a perfect\u00a0consistency and you can clearly taste the ripe mango that has been used. And while you could taste the sweetness of the sugar it did not overpower\u00a0the mango taste, which is rare!\nThe Avocado Juice (Rs. 180) was equally delicious. It was a proper glass of fresh avocado but a little too sweet for me.\nI'm the biggest sucker for food on display. Since it was staring right at us, we got the\u00a0Chicken Burger (Rs. 150). It was probably one of the worst burgers I have tried, in my life.\nThe burger had the world's thinnest patty on top of\u00a0a sad little lettuce with a teaspoon of cheese spread (you can barely taste it) and tiny tomato and gherkin slices\u00a0along with a big piece of onion which they were clearly too lazy to chop into slices. My friend tried the chicken patty and immediately said it was at least a day old. The bun was bland and the veggies were soggy. Needless to say, we didn't finish it.\nIf I'm being completely honest there is nothing positive I can say about the service and ambience. The service, though quick, was\u00a0appalling. There were two women behind the counter and had no interest in serving us. They were busy arranging some bottles and clearly looked as if they were annoyed we disturbed them.\nThe ambience wasn't any better. It's a small place with a couple of high chairs and one table near the window. There were so many flies which was disgusting and then there was this random chair nearly blocking the entrance yet no one bothered to move it.\nTheir main selling products are the juices, which they have perfected, but everything else is really bad. So I might grab a juice to go if I'm in the area or\n, but unless they work on their service and ambience, I doubt I'd return.\n",
