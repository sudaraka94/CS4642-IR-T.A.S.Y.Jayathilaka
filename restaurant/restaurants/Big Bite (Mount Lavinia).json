  "reviews": "Big Bite in Mount Lavinia is one of the few places where you can get yourself a proper Pakistani biriyani. It's spicier than most, but it's still damn good, especially coupled with their barbequed chicken.\nSo there's been quite a few places with the Big Bite moniker throughout the years, some related and others not so much, and each of these spots seems to differ when it comes down to quality. If we had to pick our favourite, Big Bite Mount Lavinia would take the top spot. When they first started out about 3+ years back, they actually had a menu with a few different dishes, though now they seem to be sticking with just their biriyani and barbecue chicken.\nTheir barbecue chicken is also phenomenal. While the BBQ chicken biriyani does cost nearly twice as much as the regular, it's still totally worth it. You get a massive hind quarter which is cooked just right on a charcoal barbeque. The real secret to this one is in the marinade they use which clearly has quite a bit chilli going on, but still not overpowerlingly, so that it doesn't throw off the balance of seasoning.\nBig Bite occupies a small spot on Galle Road in Mount Lavinia. They serve biriyani throughout the day so people generally get it to go. However, if you are looking to sit and dine, Big Bite does have a bit of space inside with a few tables. It's certainly not the cleanest dining environment but when the biriyani is this good, we don't really mind.\nBig Bite in Mount Lavinia does an downright outstanding biriyani and barbecue chicken. It's spicy but in terms of value for money and overall flavour, these guys are pretty tough to beat.\nBig Bite in Mount Lavinia is one of the few places where you can get yourself a proper Pakistani biriyani. It's spicier than most, but it's still damn good, specially coupled with their barbequed chicken.\nIf you're in the neighborhood, this Big Bite is worth a stop for the BBQ chicken and biriyani. Pakistani influenced and good.\n\n\u0db4\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dc0\u0dd4\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dc0\u0d9c\u0dda\u0db8 \u0db6\u0dd2\u0d9c\u0dca \u0db6\u0dba\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dd4\u0dad\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0d91\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db1\u0ddc\u0d9c\u0dd0\u0dbd\u0db4\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0db8 \u0dbb\u0dc3 \u0d87\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0dc1\u0dcf\u0d9b\u0dcf \u0d9c\u0dab\u0db1\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dba\u0dd4\u0dad\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0dc5\u0db3 \u0db1\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dca. \u0d85\u0db4\u0dd2\u0da7 \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0db4\u0dd4\u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9c\u0dbd\u0dca\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dda \u0db6\u0dd2\u0d9c\u0dca \u0db6\u0dba\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3 \u0db6\u0dd2\u0d9c\u0dca \u0db6\u0dba\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dca \u0dc1\u0dcf\u0d9b\u0dcf \u0dc0\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca. \u0d92\u0d9a \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0d9c\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda \u0db4\u0dcf\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dad\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca. \u0d91\u0dc4\u0dd2 \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf \u0d87\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc1\u0dd2\u0dc2\u0dca\u0da7 \u0d85\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf\u0db8\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dc3\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca \u0db6\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dd2 (\u0da0\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0db1\u0dca/\u0db8\u0da7\u0dca\u0db1\u0dca) \u0dc3\u0dc4 \u0db6\u0dcf\u0db6\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dca.
