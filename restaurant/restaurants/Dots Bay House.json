  "reviews": "Hiriketiya Beach feels like its just emerging into the mainstream after several years in the post-war travel underground. It's really small, I mean you can walk across it in ten minutes, and is still peppered with only a few businesses. The place largely attracts surfers and backpackers, and a few people from Sri Lanka who seem to dig its rather undiscovered feel.\nOne of those businesses is Dots Bay House, occupying land claimed out of the marshes that surround Hiriketiya. It functions as a hostel, restaurant, art and community space.\nIt is very open plan in design and\u00a0I like how the space\u00a0merges with the lagoon and the surrounding environment. On quiet evenings there is a steady roar of crickets and other insects that blends into background music.\nInstagrammers rejoice, the food is presented in dishes that complement the furniture,\u00a0the pastel shades, the\u00a0minimalist shapes and industrial structures of the design.\u00a0Tables are either solid wood or made out of metal barrels. Cement benches line the edges of the space, looking out over the marshes.\nDots Bay House often plays host to performances,\u00a0we'd\u00a0watched The One Who Loves You So by Arun Welandawe-Prematilleke the previous night, and The Soul and Larry T\u00a0were billed for\u00a0NYE. This Saturday there was a local artisans' market in full swing.\nThe vibe is chill, and good.\u00a0The prices fit well into the upmarket backpacker bracket. The\u00a0clientele is mostly white, but unlike Mirissa, there is no brownophobia here. I didn't stay there so I can't say much about the hotel experience, but I did hang out here for a while and tried the food, so let me tell you about that.\nWe sipped cocktails\u00a0out of handmade metal\u00a0straws made by\n. The straws were a bit too thin for the job, and bits of fruit kept blocking them up, it turned out later the staff had served us with the wrong straws, we saw others drinking out of ones with a bigger circumference.\nThe Passionfruit Mojito (Rs. 750) (right) was\u00a0good. The Bacardi had a\u00a0slight bite, but the mint complemented\u00a0the acidic taste of the passion fruit really well, even though it was a little bitter towards the end.\u00a0Papaya in a cocktail isn't normal, but the Shrubs Up (Rs. 750)\u00a0was pretty baller. The chili in the vodka and mint was what did it, making it taste\u00a0like an accharu in a glass. Try the watermelon version if they have it, I hear its just as good, if not\u00a0better.\nThe coffee (Americano - Rs. 350) was\u00a0presented ready made for an instagram picture with whatever hifalutin book you're not actually reading but carry around to impress people (in coffee shops and online) with. It also tasted good, in case that's important. I liked the single Hawaiian cookie placed on the tray.\nWe liked The Prawns (Rs. 800), but it would have been way too little as a complete meal for a hungry person, assuming you want to eat a complete meal of only prawns.\u00a0They were crispy and the lemon and correander mayo was the\u00a0perfect seasoning.\nThe Sausage (Rs. 800) (top left) was also really good, the creamy mash potato\u00a0contributed a softness\u00a0to the chicken bratwurst, which was\u00a0fresh and meaty. The onion gravy was\u00a0a great partner to the tangy taste of the meat.\nThe vegetarian options weren't the best. The Penne (Rs. 750)\u00a0(top right)\u00a0 pasta had\u00a0parsley, zucchini and\u00a0green pepper but in unsatisfactory quantities. The veggies were also\u00a0a\u00a0little too soggy while the pasta was a little too dry. It\u00a0tasted bland and the cream cheese's sourness wasn\u2019t countered by anything else. The herbs in it had some promise, but some more light spicing wouldn't have gone amiss.\u00a0The Nachos (Rs. 650)\u00a0came with banana chips. A little burnt and too dry. The melted mozzarella didn\u2019t do enough to soften it.\u00a0The sour cream did, but unfortunately there wasn\u2019t much of it in the dish.\nNote that the menu we tried was an intermediate one because the kitchen at Dots House was being renovated. The new kitchen should be up and ready by the new year, with a brand new menu to boot. So\u00a0lettuce\u00a0know what you think of the food when you go.\nWas a hit. The Chocolate Brownie (Rs. 450) was soft and yielding with a middle that had\u00a0a good solid density to it. The semi-whipped cream was airy but stll retained substance. It wasn't\u00a0too sweet and the multiple textures created a melt-in-the-mouth kinda situation.\u00a0The chocolate sauce was light.\nIf you have instructions to stay away from sweet things, looking at this brownie being consumed will definitely test your self-control.\nDots Bay House is staffed by locals.\u00a0They seemed to be having fun at work, always something that translates well into good service.\nA relaxed place\u00a0with great service, Dots is\u00a0great to have as a base while you surf or chill on the Hiriketiya beach.\u00a0 The drinks are spiffing, but\u00a0the food is only about sixty-forty good. We support its support for local economics, art and crafts.\n",
