  "reviews": "Sweet Layers is a home baker based in Piliyandala. They offer a range\n of baked goods, but their pastries are what really sets them apart.\nWe\n recently did a\n, and most of them are \npretty awesome. While Colombo has it\u2019s abundance of home bakers, those \nwho live in the suburbs have less of a choice, so it\u2019s great to see \nplaces like Sweet Layers coming up. It\u2019s run by a family so they operate\n from their house in Bokundara, where you can pick up the orders. They \noffer cakes, cupcakes, muffins, brownies, and pastries (both savory and sweet),\n with a minimum quantity of 10.\nWhile most of their stuff were \npretty good, their pastries were what really impressed us. They offer \nboth sweet danish pastries (Rs. 75) and savory puff pastries (Rs. 60). \nThe prices are also very reasonable since these were a lot better than \nwhat you get at bakeries but at pretty much the same price. Just by \nlooking at them we knew they were gonna be good since they looked pretty perfect. Trust me it is not easy to get a proper shape, it either puffs \nup too much or you end up with charred edges. The taste was just as good\n as the look with the chicken pastry having a creamy filling with plenty\n of chicken. The danish pastries had a light sugar glaze on top, one \nwith a thick chocolate filling and the other with marmalade.\nWe \ntried both their vanilla (Rs. 80) and chocolate chip (Rs. 85) cupcakes \nand they were also quite nice. The Vanilla cupcake came with a basic \nbutter cake and the latter came with chocolate cake with chocolate \nchips. The real highlight of both of these cupcakes were the frosting. \nI'm not easily impressed when it comes to frosting but I'd gladly eat a \ntub of this (I have a problem, I know). The chocolate cupcake was \nparticularly interesting since it had a layer of chocolate ganache over \nthe butter frosting which added a nice contrast of textures.\nThe \nblueberry muffins (Rs.\u00a0 60) were spongy with the flavour of the \nblueberry coming through well. This one was quite simple but we were \nfine with that since the muffin had just right texture and an adequate \namount of blueberry. A good choice for those looking for something that \nisn't overly sweet.\nThe chocolate centered macarons (Rs. 75) were \nthe odd ones out here since they did have quite a bit of room for \nimprovement. Appearance is key in a macaron and even the slightest flaw \ncan be noticeable since it has to be perfectly circular, and the ones we\n got had a few oval sides. Flavourwise they were fine, but the texture \nwas just a bit too dense and didn't have the wafer-like biscuit we were looking for. Macarons are notorious for being difficult to master with only the likes of\nreally nailing it. Judging by the perfection of their pastries, we think Sweet Layers should be able to figure it out with time.\n",
