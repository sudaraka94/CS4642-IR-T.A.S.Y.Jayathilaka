  "reviews": "This Colombo\u00a0institution is a great spot to have a drink, a light meal or a snack and to chill out in a peaceful and natural setting.\nAt the very back of the Barefoot retail store in Colombo 3 -\u00a0away from exhaust fumes and klaxons -\u00a0you\u2019ll find a lush and vast courtyard. This is the\u00a0Barefoot Garden Caf\u00e9: an oasis in bustling Colombo.\nWhile the food can be a bit over-rated here, the quality and extensive choice of drinks, the location and the ambience make it an ideal stop for a shopping break or a lazy sunny afternoon or evening.\nBarefoot Garden Caf\u00e9 offers a large range of drinks: from fresh juices, smoothies, mil\u00a0shakes, tea, coffees to beer\u00a0and wine. You will surely find something to quench your thirst, and at a pretty reasonable price.\nOn this hot and sunny day, we opted for a lime and mint soda (Rs. 320) and their homemade ginger beer (Rs. 460). The drinks delivered and were very refreshing.\nAlthough the ginger beer is bit pricey, it\u2019s actually worth digging your wallet for: it's spicy, refreshing and well balanced. If you're wondering, the floating chickpea-looking ball in the glass is a sultana and not something that fell\u00a0from the canopy above.\nThe lime and mint soda was also nice and fresh and it\u2019s always a good option to have the syrup on the side to sweeten it up as you please.\nCoffees are of good quality in Barefoot Garden Caf\u00e9 and reasonably priced. The cherry on the cake is that they all come with a lovely little biscotti, \u00e0 l\u2019italienne.\nIn need of a jolt of energy, my companion got a double espresso (Rs. 300). Look at that crema! Beautiful! Being addicted to crema since my youngest age, I couldn\u2019t resist jumping on the cup and getting the first sip. It was subtle and aromatic and provided the promised punch.\nBarefoot Garden Caf\u00e9 menu caters for everyone and every need: bites for those feeling peckish, more substantial meals like sandwiches, quiches and curries for rumbling stomachs and desserts for the sweet tooth.\nOur emphasis this time was on sandwiches. Bread was fresh and soft. Some effort and creativity was put into the fillings but the end result was not spectacular.\nThe Roast Pork sandwich (RS. 750) was rather alright. The meat, which had been marinated in soy sauce, was tasty but a bit dry. The sandwich definitely lacked green goodness and unfortunately the salad was more of an ornament to the plate.\nThe Fresh Tuna Sandwich (Rs. 750) raised the game. The pan-seared tuna was moist and the tomato salsa (made of tomato, capsicum, garlic, chili and oil) enlightened the dish. Simple but efficient.\nWe then indulged in the Death By Chocolate Cake (Rs. 770) and the Passion Fruit Mousse (Rs. 680), which happily happened to be a great combo. The light and fluffy texture of the mousse and the tanginess of the passion fruit beautifully accompanied the rich and dense chocolatey cake. A tad too sweet though. I probably won\u2019t rate them as the best desserts in town but they were still quite good.\nUndeniably their biggest asset!\nDecked out with contemporary wooden furniture and their own colorful Barefoot branded table linen and decorations, the caf\u00e9 mirrors the vibrant and elegant style of the shop.\nNestled in a peaceful courtyard paved with uneven stones and scattered with ponds and majestic trees casting pleasant shade in the afternoon, Barefoot Garden Caf\u00e9 atmosphere is very serene. You\u2019ll feel miles away from the hectic Galle Road in no time.\nThe excellent choice of jazzy music in the background adds to the coziness and timelessness of the place. I find the whole ambience really inviting and relaxing. You just want to sit down, enjoy a drink or two in good company and forget about the time.\nThe service perfectly matches the ambience of the caf\u00e9; it is extremely pleasant and efficient. We were greeted with warm smiles from the team as soon as we entered the courtyard. The staff is attentive and friendly as well as helpful. They were knowledgeable about the menu and gave us good recommendation when we were hesitating between dishes.\nWhile I won\u2019t say the food is show-stopping, Barefoot Garden Caf\u00e9 is an awesome place to have a drink and unwind in Colombo, whether it\u2019s day or night when live music or quiz nights are on. One of my favourite outdoor caf\u00e9s in town.\nThis Colombo\u2019s institution is a great spot to have a drink, a light meal or a snack and to chill out in a peaceful and natural setting.\nBarefoot Cafe is undoubtedly one of the most popular hangout spots in Colombo. With it's chic outdoor setting, good food and great music its easy to see why.\nBarefoot Cafe is the best place to hang out in Colombo. It's a chilled place to meet or make friends, see art, hear music, eat good food and drink affordable beer.\n\n\u0d9a\u0ddc\u0dc5\u0db9 \u0db1\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dba \u0d9c\u0dad \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3\u0db8 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1 \u0dad\u0db8\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0db6\u0dd9\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dc6\u0dd4\u0da7\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dd0\u0dc6\u0dda. \u0d92\u0d9a \u0dba\u0dcf\u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0ddd \u0dc4\u0db8\u0dca\u0db6\u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0dc4\u0dbb\u0dd2 \u0dba\u0dcf\u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0ddd \u0d87\u0dad\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dbb\u0d9c\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0dc4\u0dbb\u0dd2 \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dc0\u0d9c\u0dda\u0db8 \u0d9a\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0d9a\u0dd8\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0db6\u0dbd\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1, \u0dc3\u0d82\u0d9c\u0dd3\u0dad\u0dba \u0d85\u0dc4\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1, \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3 \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0db8 \u0d9a\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0dc3\u0dc4 \u0daf\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0d9c\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0db4\u0dd4\u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca \u0db8\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0da7 \u0db6\u0dd3\u0dbb \u0db6\u0ddc\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca. \u0dc3\u0d82\u0da0\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0d9a\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0da7 \u0db6\u0dd9\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dc6\u0dd4\u0da7\u0dca, \u0dc3\u0dd3\u0d9c\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dba \u0dc0\u0d9c\u0dda\u0db8 \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3 \u0dc3\u0d82\u0da0\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0d9a \u0d9c\u0db8\u0db1\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca\u0dad\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dca. \u0daf\u0dda\u0dc1\u0dd3\u0dba \u0dc0\u0dd0\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0da7 \u0d92\u0d9a \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0dc5\u0db9 \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0d85\u0dad\u0dca\u200d\u0dba\u0dc0\u0dc1\u0dca\u200d\u0dba\u0db8 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca. \u0d92\u0d9a \u0d85\u0db0\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0da2\u0dca\u200d\u0dba \u0dba\u0dd4\u0d9c\u0dba\u0dda\u0daf\u0dd3 \u0dbd\u0dcf\u0d82\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dda \u0d85\u0dc0\u0dc3\u0dcf\u0db1 \u0dad\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dcf\u0db4\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dba \u0dc0\u0d9c\u0dda.\n",
