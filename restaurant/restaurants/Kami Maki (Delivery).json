  "reviews": "is one of two Japanese delivery spots in Colombo. The sushi may not be the best in town, but it\u2019s not too bad and the delivery is fast and reliable.\nColombo has roughly around ten dedicated Japanese restaurants, most of them coming up in the past five years. Unfortunately most of these places haven\u2019t started delivery yet, that is, with the exception of Kami Maki and\n. The latter has been our go to spot for Japanese delivery, although it can be frustratingly slow at times. So we decided to give Kami Maki a shot and all in all as far as delivery is concerned they made us quite happy.\nYou can get access to their entire menu through their Facebook page. It isn\u2019t a very large menu but they do have some unique fusion items, and in our opinion that\u2019s where Kami Maki excels. The phone operator had a good knowledge of the menu, and the our order was delivered in under an hour, all of it in one piece.\nLike we said earlier, Kami Maki isn\u2019t very popular for it\u2019s traditional dishes, and if that\u2019s what you prefer, we\u2019d suggest you go with Naniyori. If you\u2019re want to try something a bit different, Kami Maki does pretty well. Prices are somewhere in the lower mid range with sushi dishes starting at Rs. 590 for 6.\nTheir Teriyaki Chicken (Rs. 590) was quite tasty. We\u2019d say this was a bit better than Naniyori\u2019s but falls short when compared to the liked of\n. The teriyaki sauce was on the sweeter side but I didm\u2019t mind that much and the chicken itself was cooked well, perhaps just slightly overdone.\nThe salmon maki (Rs. 590) was okay, but the rice had very little flavour of rice wine vinegar coming through. The positive though was that the salmon was fresh.\nThe best of the bunch was the tenkasu crab with wasabi mayo (Rs. 690). We\u2019ve had this before at their restaurant, so we\u2019re happy to see that it\u2019s consistent even with their delivery. We\u2019d say this is one of their signature fusion dishes with the addition of the sichimi, crunch of the sesame seeds and a nice balanced flavour from the wasabi mayo.\nThe crunchy salmon sushi with chilli mayo (Rs. 690) was also quite good and will likely please most local palates. Combine that with the fresh salmon and added crunch and you have a pretty tasty sushi.\nKami Maki does a pretty good take on some adventurous fusion sushi, with fast and reliable delivery to boot.\n",
