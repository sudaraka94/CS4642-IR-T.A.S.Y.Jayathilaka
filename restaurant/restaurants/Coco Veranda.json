  "reviews": "Coco Veranda's a familiar sight down Ward Place, and has a loyal customer base who continues to clamour for their sugar-heavy drinks and decadent cakes and desserts. They also offer a variety of burgers, pastas, and your regular cafe fare.\nCoco's service used to be great once upon a time, but has dropped as of the last two years. It certainly hasn't improved much since our last review, with items arriving late and half the staff looking too preoccupied. There was one person behind the counter though, who had a permanent smile, was welcoming, and helpful. One thing though, everything took quite a long time to get to the table. The sandwich took just over 15 minutes, and then we had to ask for and wait a bit more for the dessert, which is weird because it's already prepared and just sitting there anyway. When we asked for an extra plate and table water, those took close to 10 minutes to get to us \u2014 definitely too long to wait for just a plate.\nAmbience has remained pretty much the same, and that's where Coco has nailed it. Dim yellow lighting, dark brown wooden furniture, a good playlist \u2014 it's a great location for a quiet conversation.\nMostly popular for their chocolate-heavy concoctions which are well executed, their food isn't half bad.\nWe went for a Peri Peri Sandwich which was Rs. 590. They told us to pick our bread preferences, and we opted for a brown baguette \u2014 the bill later showed me that there's an extra charge (of 70 rupees) separately for that, which is kind of ridiculous given that the bread isn't an add-on.\nWith just enough nicely spiced chicken sandwiched in the warm bread, it had a few really thick slices of tomato and a fresh bit of lettuce added in. Was this a good sandwich? It was alright. Was it worth 700+ rupees? No, not really.\nWe\nlike the Cinnamon Mocha with Salt and Pepper though.\nPriced at Rs. 610, it was a definite treat especially if you're having it on a gloomy, rainy evening and when you're curled up with a book. As with many amazing drinks, what hits you first is the\n. Who'd ever have thought that pepper could taste so good? In this, it does.\nThe Chocolate Mint Blend (Rs. 680) is also a winner in our books because of how consistently perfect it is. Basically a very well executed milkshake, it's blended with just the right amount of mint. If you're going to have anything else with this, don't, because that's how filling this is. You're basically going to be in a chocolate-induced food coma soon after getting this down.\nOn the down side, we really didn't like the Cappuccino (Rs. 470). It had a bitter, burnt aftertaste to it which we've experienced before with a bunch of their other coffees over the last year or two as well. This is one of the reasons I opt for the chocolatey or fruity drinks here instead of the caffeinated ones, but had to try this out just to give it a go.\nFor dessert, we got the Chocolate Caramel Slice (Rs. 340) and a Mississippi Mud Pie (Rs. 360). The caramel slice had a very thick coconut base to it, which was unexpected and not wholly welcome when you're not expecting coconut in your caramel slice. The coconut flavour overpowered everything else, and as two people who love caramel and aren't massive fans of coconut, this was rather disappointing.\nOn the other hand, the mud pie was really good \u2014 decadent and dense, the chocolate was rich and filling and the whipped cream was light and fresh.\nWe haven't had happy experiences with Coco's coffees for a couple of years now, but we do love their desserts and most of their other drinks. They've pretty much nailed it in terms of ambience and could up their service, it could be quite a satisfactory experience overall.\nCoco Veranda's a familiar sight down Ward Place, and has a loyal customer base who continues to clamour for their sugar-heavy drinks and decadent cakes and desserts\nCoco Veranda on Ward Place is one of Colombo's most popular coffee shops.
