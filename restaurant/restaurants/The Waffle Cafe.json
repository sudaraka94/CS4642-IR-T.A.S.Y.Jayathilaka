  "reviews": "We did a First Look at Waffle Cafe when it used to be in Pita Kotte and had a decent experience. Now that they have moved on to Perehera Mawatha, we decided to drop in again. I can safely say they have improved a lot since our last visit, especially in terms of their sweet waffles. It's located at the halfway point on\u00a0Perehera Mawatha to your left, opposite Beira Lake.\nEverything is waffle related; from sweet and savory to vegetarian and an all-day breakfast section. Aside from the waffles which are legit Belgian waffles, they also have a few starters.\nThe Shanghai Shrimp (Rs. 950) was Chinese chili prawns on top of a waffle with a side of coleslaw. The prawns were incredible! They were well cooked and chewy, soaked in a delicious spicy sauce that had just the right amount of fire along with a tinge of sweetness. If you're a seafood fan, there's nothing better. The waffle\u00a0itself was great with a crispy texture. It didn't have a lot of flavors which was good because the prawns were the highlight.\nThankfully, the vegetarians have not been left out. The Quack (Rs. 700) which was basically mock duck cooked in fiery chili sauce hit us in all the right places. Even you weren't a vegetarian, you would probably love this. The sauce tasted more or the less the same as the prawns one but the mock duck was a great surprise. It was chewy and quite meaty that it almost felt like you're eating meat. I thoroughly enjoyed myself.\nWe also tried the Chocolate Fudge (Rs. 560) from the sweet section and this is undoubtedly a chocolate lover's\u00a0dream. The warm melted chocolate went perfectly with the thick waffles. The waffles especially were great because of its thick consistency which held well together and did not leave\u00a0us with a soggy mess.\nIf you're not the biggest chocolate fan, you can go with something like the Custard Cream (Rs. 500) which is a lot less sweet. I wish it was a bit creamier because the consistency was too thin. Other than that, it combines well with waffles. We wanted to try the Blueberry waffles but unfortunately, it wasn't available.\nI should mention, one waffle is more than enough for you, trust me. You should only eat more than one if you're sharing. The portions are massive and the toppings are quite heavy.\nThey have a separate\u00a0drinks menu which has coffee, tea, hot chocolate, fruit juices, and milkshakes.\nThe Hot Chocolate (Rs. 400) was really good, albeit a little too sweet for my taste. However, there was a strong chocolate taste with a thick milky texture. It's ideal to have on a rainy day, which was how the weather was that day.\nWe also tried a Chocolate Milkshake (Rs. 400) which was way too sweet. As they usually are. It wasn't the worst thing we could have had, but I wish they were a little careful on the sugar.\nTheir service was alright, but I did find it annoying the fact that a few of the toppings we asked were told to be not available. It's always wise to have some cash with you because the pos machine wasn't working that day.\nThe place is definitely smaller and congested than the previous place, but it's not bad. The designs are the same and it was neat and lovely.\nThe food is excellent. The prices are a little steep but honestly, you're much better off trying these waffles than from any other high-end cafes. The portions are big, filling and really delicious. Give it a go.\nSome excellent sweet and savory flavors to go with fluffy Belgian waffles.\nBest new waffles in town? Yep.\n\n\u0d94\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0da2\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dbd\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dc3\u0da7 \u0db6\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dca\u0da2\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca, \u0dbd\u0dd3\u0da2\u0dca \u0dc0\u0ddc\u0dc6\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dbd \u0dbb\u0dc3 \u0db6\u0dbd\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0d9a\u0dd0\u0db8\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0db1\u0db8\u0dca, \u0dc3\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db1\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dd4\u0dc0 \u0dc0\u0ddc\u0dc6\u0dbd\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dd0\u0dc6\u0dda \u0d91\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1.\n",
