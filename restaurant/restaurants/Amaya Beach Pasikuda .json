  "description": "Amaya is one of the big hotels on Pasikuda bay. It's huge, and though looks-wise is a little old school, is still incredibly efficient and ideal for some holiday pampering. ",
  "reviews": "Amaya Resorts & Spas is a\nwell known chain of hotels, formerly known as Centara, and on our last trip to\nPasikuda we stayed over at their luxurious resort Amaya Beach. Structurally it\nmay feel a little stodgy and old school - concrete columns, closed corridors,\nthe live Sri Lankan band in the main restaurant - but the resort is still very\nefficient with great service and rooms made for pampering.\nThe hotel is pretty huge, and although is only about three years old, feels\nlike it's been around for longer. They've got a very long heavily chlorinated\nswimming pool (goggles advised), and the dining space and many of the rooms\nabove face it. The pool-side is the nicest space in the resort to hang out at,\nespecially in the evenings.\nInside it's more imposing and 90's traditional, with long concrete-cocoon\ncorridors, glimpses into the green and blue outside, but only little ones, so\nyou're made to really stay indoors and self indulge. The main restaurant is\nlarge and lit up from the ceiling at nights with buffet tables set at angles,\nwhich may remind you of family-friendly-hotels a decade ago.\nThey've got a very cosy modern bar and lounge called Aqua by the pool, and\nalso an Indian restaurant Spice Market opening soon. Also, we were told this is\nthe only hotel on the stretch with a huge banquet hall for business\ngatherings.\nThe rooms are extremely comfortable and state of the art, with electronic\ncard locks and automated A/Cs. It's very hard to leave once you get into bed or\ninto a hot bath.\nIt's expensive though, with a full-board double in a basic Superior room\ncosting you about Rs. 30K. However, the rooms are very spacious and luxurious,\nso this is not your average run-of-the-mill stay-over, plus the Pasikuda Bay\nresorts are generally notorious for their rates. Amaya offers deals though, if\nyou're visiting with family or on business.\nOn our visit we sampled the BBQ evening buffet on Saturday. There's a small\nrange of Indian foods, salads and freshly grilled steaks and fish - the food\nwas alright but for Rs. 3000, it didn't seem like value for money, considering\ntaste and variety.\nThe main restaurant however serves a surprisingly great burger and fries.\nThe patty was made medium rare, succulent ground meat, with warm buns and fresh\ntomatoes. The fries were also very well done, crisp and warm, and the kind\nthat's addictive.\nWe also got a pizza, which came with plenty of meat and cheese and was\nskilfully put together in terms of quality, although it could have used a bit\nmore spice - ask for chilli flakes. The food in the main restaurant is in the\nRs. 1000-1500 range. Service was good and\nattentive and generally unobtrusive.\nPasikuda is probably the best place in the\nisland for a swim - the ocean is one big infinity pool with a view of the sky,\nand it's perfection especially early mornings and at sunset. Unfortunately the\nshore has become dramatically narrow in the past few years and there's barely\nabout five feet of sand before you reach the water. So although the Pasikuda\nBay, where Amaya and other hotels are lined up, is great for a swim, it's not\nmuch for chilling on the beach.\nAlso, check out\n, a group that collabs with\nAmaya and other resorts on the stretch.\nAmaya is big with tourists and business groups, and is a reliable bet if\nyou're in Pasikuda and want to really indulge yourself.\n",
