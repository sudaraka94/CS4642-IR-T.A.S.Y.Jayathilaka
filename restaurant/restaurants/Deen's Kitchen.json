  "reviews": "Where Isipathana Mawatha meets Havelock Road, a small shop appears. Carefully hidden under the pretence of a kitchen- this stop is not for the faint of heart... literally.\nWith massive and yet unappetizing portions, Deen\u2019s Kitchen is - as Shifani puts it - \u201cOK food for hungry boys with no standards.\u201d\nRightly so. With an arsenal of greasy food, it\u2019s no wonder Deen\u2019s Kitchen musters entire Rugby teams from Havvies and classes of students from Royal Institute.\nThe only downside of being a YAMU agent is that it requires you to go undercover - which can be difficult if you\u2019re in a restaurant with a large camera snapping pictures at every plate, glass, and guest that comes your way. Done to ensure we get authentic service it pays to be the strong, silent type - a Yamurai of sorts. Having done so I can say with confidence that the owner of the shop, who I assume is Deen himself, is extremely friendly. His customers are chummy with him and he makes an open effort to talk to his customers and get along with service. However what is mostly American \u2018fast\u2019 food takes an eon to arrive. I did wait a bit. I was told it was because of the layered Godzilla Sandwich which is the restaurant's flagship item. Rice and Curry on the other hand whizzed out of the kitchen.\nAmbience-wise, Deen\u2019s Kitchen retains the sort of atmosphere you\u2019d expect from a site like this. Small and congested, the place resembles what would happen if a take-out kitchen and a bicycle garage had a baby. I saw packets of buns under the counter, a strange cup in the corner, while a TV played Blood Diamond with DiCaprio killing it. Like DiCaprio\u2019s eternal wait for an Oscar, I waited for my Godzilla Sandwich while the seemingly dark, mysterious kitchen made sputtering and sizzling noises at the back.\nHappy Day! My order was ready. The Godzilla, was wrapped in foil along with the milo and burger. I headed out and trekked it to YAMU HQ.\nOnce there, myself along with fellow agents Shifani and Bhagya peered at the parcel. What lay inside next took us all off guard.\nUnwrapping the Godzilla was a messy task. At Rs. 888, this behemoth oozed out cheese and sauce from its foil. Finally, it stood before us large and proud with an abundance of eggs, sausage, cheese and chicken spilling over the edges.\n\u201cI can smell the cholesterol off that one.\u201d Dinesh tells Janith.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look all that bad.\u201d I lie to myself.\n\u201c-Hush.\u201d Bhagya cuts in.\u00a0\u201cListen.\u201d\nShifani brings her head close to Bhagya\u2019s half of the sandwich.\n\u201cWoah. Trippy.\u201d\nI bring my ear up to mine too.\nOil.\nBhagya presses the sandwich.\n\u201cIt sounds like a sponge full of soapy water.\u201d\nI bite into it. With the bread soggy and full of oil my mouth becomes a lake full of mush. Apart from the oil, the fried egg swims around, the sausages squish beneath my teeth. The only thing passable is the chicken \u2013 done right and the only thing offering texture other than the crunch rendered from the lettuce. Even the chips in the sandwich (?) are soggy from the oil.\u00a0Shifani and Bhagya, full of sickly-rich filling have already waddled back to their desks.\nI put the artery-splitting sandwich away.  Half dizzy, I plough my way through the crispy chicken burger (Rs. 360) . This one looks okay. You can still taste the oil though. Sort of like a cheap, oily KFC zinger, the crispy chicken burger looks like Colonel Sanders fell into a frying pan. There really isn\u2019t much here. It\u2019s a tad bit better than the Godzilla. The chicken once again offers a modicum of taste and texture whereas everything else is simply overpowered by the thickening taste of oil.\u00a0One\u00a0thing you've got to give them is they're generous on the meat.\nThe only great thing was the iced Chocomilo at Rs. 200. Up until now I\u2019ve never understood why people go head over heels for Milo. Now I do. This one is slightly unconventional. Bordering on the thick side and cooled to perfection this one is an exceptional drink for a hot Colombo evening. There isn\u2019t oil in this one, so your heart can rest easy. Sort of.\nDeen\u2019s Kitchen is a lot like it\u2019s food \u2013 full of the good and the bad. You\u2019ve got friendly service, terrible ambiance and oily food stacked together in a mess so tall Godzilla himself couldn\u2019t tackle it. We all felt stuffed and sickish. I suppose if you\u2019re looking for heavy food to watch a late night cricket match with your \u2018machangs\u2019 whose only demand is to be stuffed, these heart-thumping giants will satisfy.\nDeen's Kitchen, as Shifani puts it is \"Okay food for hungry boys with no standards.\" . \nRightly so.\nRather greasy and heavy food.\n",
