  "reviews": "There's an unmissable spot, called Fish Point,\u00a0along Beach Road (basically the extension of Galle Rd, the main road going South on to Mirissa) where a few open air stalls sell fish, cook it and also serve it to you while you sit on the beach at Weligama Bay. The concept is amazing and\u00a0it's\u00a0a great way to eat in Weli. There's a couple\u00a0of places to choose from. We tried the rather generically named, family run\u00a0'Sea Food Weligama'.\nA range of fresh seafood was on the planks. We got some Octopus (Rs. 1200 for 500g), Prawns (Rs. 1000 for 500g), Cuttlefish (Rs. 1200 for 500g) and some fish; Tuna (locally known as\nand 'Sea Chicken' (locally known as\n) for Rs. 1000 per kilo. Yes, these prices are high, and yes we might have gotten\u00a0fleeced a little. Remember to bring your negotiation skills when you eat here. But also remember that you're paying for service and location and not just the fish.\nThe meal is complemented with Rice, Salad and Chips. All of it is basic, but good and wholesome. They added up another 1200 or so for the rice and complements, as mentioned previously, all prices are generally open for negotiation.\nA generous dose of fresh kankun and asparagus complemented almost everything, there was\u00a0 also a slight excess of oil, but not crazily so.\nWe stopped the kitchen from adding tomato ketchup to our food, and insisted on just cooking it with oil and garlic instead, sprinking lime over the top.\nThe end effect was very good. Simply made, fresh seafood with some greens and rice.\n(Sea Chicken)\nLalitha the cook/\u00a0salesperson/\u00a0bargainer-in-chief however insisted we should try it with her special sauce next time. Let us know if you go by and do that.\n(The Kitchen)\nThe service experience is down and dirty, lots of bargaining and discussion precludes your sit down and eating experience. But it all happens on a very friendly level. Our food was delivered quickly and we were attended to very well.\nIs the Weligama Bay. You can't ask for better ambience. There is great seating with canopies to protect you against the sun and rain, chill at the tables for as long as you want and alternate your bites of fish with dips in the sea if you like.\nBargain your way into a great, fresh\u00a0caught, fresh cooked meal at Fishpoint. The meal cost us just above Rs. 6,000 for 5 very hungry and ultimately very satisfied people.\n",
