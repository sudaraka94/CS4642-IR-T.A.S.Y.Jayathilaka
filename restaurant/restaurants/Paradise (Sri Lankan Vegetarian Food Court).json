  "reviews": "The grandiosely titled 'Paradise', or Sri Lankan Vegetarian Food Court, is a convenient little vegetarian rice and curry spot next to the BCC's Sri Sambuddhatva Jayanthi Mandira. The prices are easy on the wallet and they've also got a juice bar.\nThe food pictures here are taken by our friend\n.\nWe got two plates of rice and curry - red rice and white rice - for Rs. 200 each. We're glad there's the option of red rice for people who want to eat healthier. We got a hefty bit of everything: tasty parippu, spinach, beans, manioc, pumpkin, red chilli and ambarella chutney, though you can pick what you want in your dish. The rice and curry was flavoursome and pretty filling, and that's saying something for a dish that has no meat in it - although we have enjoyed fresher rice and curry at places like\n. Definitely value for money though, considering the large assortment of sides.\nThey've also got a fruit bar, where you can get a glass of freshly blended juice for about Rs. 150. Not all the flavours are always available though. We got a watermelon juice, and it was alright though more water than melon. They've also got a few veg pastries and eggless cakes here, we had a white frosting cake and it was creamy and didn't taste too bad for a quick snack.\nParadise has got a bakery style space when you walk in, and a long inner room with dining tables and a simple village painting on the wall. It's clean and cosy but felt rather warm during our visit, though usually there's an A/C that functions. We saw a lot of office folks on their lunch break and students from the Buddhist Cultural Centre's building next door. Service was quite good - all you have to do is pay the cashier first and hand your bill over to the lady behind the rice and curry counter.\nThere aren't a lot of vegetarian options in the city, save for the occasional veg-friendly Indian restaurant or saivar kade. So we're really glad there's an affordable rice and curry option for vegetarians here at Paradise. It's an easy choice for lunch without spending a lot, and healthier if you pick the red rice and get a fruity beverage.\nParadise is a convenient vegetarian rice and curry stop next to the Buddhist Cultural Centre. It's easy on the wallet and they've also got a juice bar.\nParadise is a lovely vegetarian cafe in the shadow of the Sri Sambuddha Jayanthi building near Thumulla junction. It's exceptionally clean and serves great vegetarian rice and curry and eggless desserts.\n\n\u0db4\u0dd0\u0dbb\u0da9\u0dba\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda \u0dad\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dca\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd \u0dc4\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dda \u0dc1\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd3 \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dca\u0db6\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u0db0 \u0da2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0d9c\u0ddc\u0da9\u0db1\u0dd0\u0d9c\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd \u0d85\u0dc3\u0dbd, \u0d91\u0dc4\u0dd2 \u0dc3\u0dd9\u0dc0\u0dab\u0dda \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dc4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dd2 \u0db1\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dca\u0db8\u0dcf\u0d82\u0dc1 \u0d86\u0dc4\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dc4\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dca. \u0d91\u0dba \u0d85\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd4 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca. \u0d94\u0dc0\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3 \u0db1\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dca\u0db8\u0dcf\u0d82\u0dc1 \u0db6\u0dad\u0dca \u0dc4\u0dcf \u0dc0\u0dca\u200d\u0dba\u0d82\u0da2\u0db1\u0dad\u0dca \u0db6\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad\u0dbb \u0db1\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0d85\u0dad\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0db4\u0dc3\u0dad\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0db1\u0db8\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf.\n",
