  "reviews": "The Grand Indian has been a mainstay in Nuwara Eliya\u2019s dining scene over the years, and for good reason. They serve top notch North Indian cuisine at reasonable prices with impressive consistency.\nNuwara Eliya\u2019s restaurant scene hasn\u2019t seen many new introductions over the past few years but The Grand Indian has been going strong for over a decade now. Their prices may seem expensive at first glance but their menu prices are inclusive of taxes and service charge, so it\u2019s actually pretty tame all things considered.\nThe menu leaned\u00a0more towards North Indian cuisine with a decent selection of South Indian vegetarian dishes.\nWhile waiting for\u00a0our mains to arrive,\u00a0we tried out their Mutton Samosa (Rs. 250) which actually looked more like little patties. These weren\u2019t golden brown but still had plenty of crunch without being too thick. The mutton filling was minced and full of flavour from the spice mix which had a subtle heat and a good amount of seasoning.\n\nGrand Indian\u2019s Lamb Biriyani (Rs. 950) is something I\u2019ve tried three times this year and it\u2019s been on point every single time. This doesn\u2019t come with a ton of bells and whistles but it stays true to the classic biriyani flavours and spices which really bind to the long grain basmati. The real highlight of this biriyani, however, was the lamb which was tender and lightly spicy with a few fatty pieces which were just so tasty.\nOn the bready end, we got the Cheese Kulcha (Rs. 250) as a change up to the usual naans. The portion here isn\u2019t massive but it actually complemented our biriyani well.\nThe kulcha wasn\u2019t as thick as we expected, but still had a good amount of cheese stuffed in it which added a welcome contrast against the crispy outer shell.\nOur Chicken Tikka Masala (Rs. 750) was a beautiful red curry which was creamy, with a strong flavour of tomato coming through. The boneless chicken was also cooked just right with meat still tender, really taking in the essence of the curry. We\u2019ve had their butter chicken in the past, and comparing the two, I\u2019d say this one comes out on top.\nGrand Indian also serves up some of the best kulfi we\u2019ve had in the country, and although that may not seem like much of a compliment considering our generally paltry standards of kulfi, this one is legit. It\u2019s milky and rich, adequately sweet with a noticeable undertone of cardamom and dried fruits.\nThe Grand Indian, located just outside The Grand Hotel\u2019s driveway, shares the space with the Coffee Bar. It\u2019s honestly not the best looking space but it gets the job done. As far as seating is concerned, they should be able to accommodate around fifty, but it\u2019s a closed space so it can get a bit loud when it\u2019s crowded.\nThe service at Grand Indian has generally been quite quick, with our food coming in around fifteen minutes on this visit. The waiters are a young and friendly bunch that know the menu well enough to make recommendations should you ask them.\nIf you\u2019re in Nuwara Eliya, Grand Indian is pretty much your only real choice for quality Indian cuisine. They stick to traditional preparations and can go toe to toe with some of Colombo\u2019s best.\n",
