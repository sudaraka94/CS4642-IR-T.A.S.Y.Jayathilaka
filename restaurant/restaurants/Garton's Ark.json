  "description": "Garton's Ark is a floating (boat) restaurant in the Nugegoda Wetlands Park. ",
  "reviews": "We did a review on Garton's Ark as soon as it opened up and\u00a0it's been about 4 years since that review.\u00a0This time around we went on their Friday\n.\nThe cruise happens every evening, and boarding starts at 7 PM. It takes off at 8.30 PM and goes on for about 2 hours down the Kirulapona Canal. It's an international buffet on Fridays and costs\u00a0Rs. 3000 per person including taxes and the boatrides.\n\nThe annoying thing is that in order to confirm your reservation\u00a0you must deposit a 50% advance to their account due to only a limited number of seats being available. This is understandable, since it's a bit different from your ordinary restaurant on land, but still.\nYou can get to the boat through the Urban Wetland Park which is about a 500m walk and while it's not enough to work up an appetite, it really helps on your way back, after eating so much. Alternatively, you can also enter directly via Pagoda Road. In addition to this, they've got smaller boats that'll ferry you across to the ark.\nThis entrance also has parking.\nAs it was an International Buffet the food was pretty much what you would get at a normal hotel buffet. The starters were delicious with fresh and crunchy salads and freshly baked buns, which I loved!\nThe mains were 50-50 actually. The spaghetti and kottu were too salty for me. The kottu especially tasted like the frozen packs you would get at a supermarket although we were later told that the rotti is prepared fresh in-house. The lasagna was delicious and cheesy while the batter fried mushrooms were pretty average but not as crispy as I would have liked them to be.\n\nThere was also a cashew curry but it was nothing to rave about. Their veggies deserve a special shout out\u00a0because they were perfectly steamed and seasoned well.\nThe desserts were just as good as the starters. The chocolate mousse was sweet with\u00a0a thick with a creamy consistency, and the mini tarts were so good that I actually wanted more even after two. The fruits - just like the veggies - were fresh and ripe.\nIf you think Rs. 3000 is too much for a dinner, we agree. But that's not all you're paying for and to be honest, as far as cruises go, this is the most affordable cruise most of us could go on. The ride was so smooth that we hardly noticed we were moving. The restaurant inside could easily accommodate 85 people and another 40 above\u00a0on the deck.\nThey had the most amazing playlist that night.\u00a0Later on, we went to the deck\u00a0and the music followed. Despite the fact that all we got for a view was overgrown sea plants and\u00a0littered water, the cool, crisp evening breeze on your face hardly make you notice it.\nUnfortunately, that only lasted so long because\u00a0a Calypso band started playing and the whole thing was ruined. Not that they were bad, it just wasn't a Calypso night. We were the only people on board and you have to know your audience. When loud music and bongos start banging while you're enjoying a peaceful dinner with great music, it just kills the mood.\nIn term of service, it was excellent. The manager was really friendly and knew his way around the place. Since we were the only ones on board, needless to say, all the attention was on us so we got to experience an extra special service. Even at the buffet, you get the chef at your service, helping you with the food and serving.\nThis was a quality experience and an ideal place to celebrate an anniversary. We were told that they have hosted parties and weddings here so the place seems to be more established than it lets on.\nThey sail on a daily basis unless there are certain obstacles obscuring this process like storms, weather conditions and floods.\nIf you're ever planning to visit, I suggest you opt for the cruise 'cause why go to a boat restaurant if you're not going to cruise?\nA boat restaurant and a cruise to enjoy a special night out.\nGarton's Ark in Weli Park is an interesting place for a weekend dinner cruise. While the buffet is a bit expensive the experience of cruising in a canal boat should be one of a kind.\n",
