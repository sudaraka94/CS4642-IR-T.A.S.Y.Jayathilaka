  "description": "Basically a place to have tea with a sweet Japanese auntie. They also sell well-chosen tea leaves. No food unless she gives you a biscuit.",
  "reviews": "The lady running the place (Hisano) recommended the Tea Soda (Rs. 300), so I tried that. It's quite nice and refreshing. The tea arrives separated into three layers, the bottom is a sort of citrus fruit cordial, to middle is a berry tea and the top is soda. When you mix it up it's quite refreshing and nice. There honestly isn't that much on the menu at this tiny tiny place (different blends of tea basically, hot or iced) but what we had was nice. They have no food, but she did serve us some Japanese cookies.\nThey also sell packaged tea, which we bought and made at office. It was just Rs. 270 for this packet of Sweet Berries tea, which really tastes like berries.\nIt's super cheap and we enjoyed it.\nThis is basically someone's house off of Kynsey Road (at the Borella end, near the De Saram Rd junction).\n",
