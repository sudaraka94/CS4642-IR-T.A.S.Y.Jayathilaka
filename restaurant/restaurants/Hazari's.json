  "reviews": "Hazari's has moved from their old cosy Thimbirigasyaya spot to a much larger ocean-facing premises on Marine Drive. Here's what we thought of the new place.\nFor starters we got the classic Hummus (Rs. 320) which looked completely unassuming in its presentation but tasted surprisingly good. The texture was perfect, not too grainy nor mushy and it didn't contain any suspicious add-ons save for some olive oil.\nThe Khubz (bread) that is served alongside the Hummus for an additional Rs. 65 was soft and\u00a0perfectly balanced out the Hummus.\nYou can't really go to a Middle Eastern Restaurant and skip out on Shawarma, so naturally we got the Beef Shawarma (Rs. 480). The bread was nice and chewy, the filling consisted of finely seasoned chunks of beef, a few chips of onion here and there, snippets of parsley and of course; sauce. The sauce was fine although they could've reduced the amount that goes into per shawarma. No complaints though, it was delicious.\nThe Khabsa Rice with Chicken (Rs. 920) was beautiful in terms of presentation. Coloured a deep orange, and served with fried brinjal, potatoes and extra onion, the rice was immensely fragrant. The\u00a0chicken\u00a0though, was a little bit of a let down. In terms of taste it was alright, but just a wee bit too dry. This would've gotten a 5/5 score from from if it weren't for the chicken but alas, some things just aren't meant to be.\nI ordered a cup of Masala Chai (Rs. 170),\u00a0but somehow the tea here is way too milky. Apart from that, it would've been a perfect cuppa because the masala came through and I could taste the cinnamon.\u00a0For Rs. 170 you get a fairly large cup.\nFinally there's the Fresh Mint Iced Tea (Rs. 170) which was excellent. I gladly forked over my Rs. 170 for this large glass full of good tea. It actually tasted of tea rather than tea flavoured water, and the mint was prominent enough to give me a refreshing chill but didn't taste like a dollop of toothpaste. Good stuff.\nThe service is excellent, the staff know what they're doing and the guys here are really friendly. They seem to know their way around the menu which is always a plus.\nThe ambience, is very clean-cut and somehow minimal (how does one be minimal when it comes to Middle Eastern decor?) with its complementing cream walls, brown furniture and a couple of Moroccan lanterns hanging from the roof. We got to sit at the very corner at one of the couch+tables\u00a0and I assume this is a good seating area if you're with a large group of friends. HOWEVER, we were plagued by flies who'd skit across our food and skulk around our plates. Horrible as it was, they assured us that it wasn't a common occurence. I hope not.\n\n\nThere's an outdoor seating area too, which is tiny but tres chic with an awesome view of the ocean. Keep in mind that it'll be hot as hell out there thanks to the annoying A/C exhaust thingamabob that's spewing out hot air because the noon-day sun just isn't hot enough.\nFriendly waitstaff, good food, a\u00a0chilled out atmosphere (inside because nobody wants to dehydrate and shrivel up in the Colombo heat) and not a migraine-inducing\u00a0over-decorated interior. Generally a cool place to get a shawarma with the fam or chill with your habibi.\nHazari's has managed to maintain their standard while moving to their new Marine Drive location.\nWith some new Middle Eastern restaurants opening up in Colombo we thought we'd revisit Hazari's. While their desserts still need work, the mains are meaty, ample in portion and spicy.\nHazari's is one of the nicest Arabic restaurants in town. We were wrong in our first review to call it just OK. They serve different and thoughtful Middle Eastern food with good service and delivery.\nHazari's has managed to maintain their Middle-Eastern standard while moving to their new Marine Drive location.\n\n\u0db8\u0dd9\u0dad\u0db1\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0db1\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db8 \u0d85\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0db6\u0dd2 \u0dbb\u0dc3 \u0d9c\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0db4\u0dd4\u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca. \u0d87\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3\u0da7 \u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd, \u0d91\u0dc4\u0dcf \u0db4\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad\u0dd9 \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0d89\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc3\u0dcf\u0d9c\u0dbb\u0dda\u0dad\u0dca \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dba \u0db4\u0ddc\u0da9\u0dca\u0da9\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db1\u0dbb\u0db9\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1.\n\n\u0dbd\u0dcf\u0db7, \u0d89\u0d9a\u0dca\u0db8\u0dab\u0dca \u0d92\u0dad\u0dca \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc1\u0dda\u0dc2 \u0db1\u0ddc\u0dc0\u0db1 \u0d85\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0db6\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0db8\n\n\"\u0bb9\u0bb8\u0bb0\u0bc0\u0bb8\u0bcd\" \u0baa\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0baf\u0bcd \u0b86\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0bb3\u0bcd\u0bb3 \u0b85\u0bb0\u0bbe\u0baa\u0bbf\u0baf \u0b89\u0ba3\u0bb5\u0b95\u0bae\u0bcd. \u0b87\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bae\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bb8\u0bcd\u0baf\u0bbe\u0baf \u0bb5\u0bc0\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bc8\u0bb5\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bc0\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0b85\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b85\u0bae\u0bc8\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb3\u0bcd\u0bb3\u0ba4\u0bc1.\n",
