  "reviews": "Tokiwa has been buzzing for a few months now with its authentic Japanese cuisine and Japanese inspired dishes. We dropped in yesterday and had a wonderful experience.\nWhile they do have some authentic Japanese dishes like omurice, fuwa fuwa, and matcha, most of what they have are what you would normally find in cafes. Like burgers, wraps, sandwiches, and salads. But of course, we tried the Japanese dishes.\nThe Omurice (Rs. 1150) is worth every penny! It was so delicious we both just sunk into our seats. It's basically a chicken and mushroom fried rice with a sweet and savory infused flavors covered with an omelette and topped off with a Hayashi sauce; which is a dark luscious sauce made with\u00a0caramelized onions, red wine, tomatoes, and a demi-glace. The fried rice had a sticky texture with delicious\u00a0tender chicken bits and mushrooms. The rice went incredibly well with the perfectly cooked egg. The Hayashi sauce was salivatingly good with rich flavors dancing in your mouth. You know an omurice is good when that knife cuts into it so smoothly.\nThe Fuwa-Fuwa Choco Banana (Rs. 850) was equally good. Fuwa-Fuwa cakes are Japanese fluffy cakes. It's literally like eating a\u00a0cloud. They are light, airy and made from a cloud-like batter. This particular dish was nothing short of perfection. The cakes were incredibly soft, fluffy and airy. They don't use a ton of sugar to keep the density at bay, which means this was right up my alley. The bananas and whipped cream were added tastes which did not overwhelm the star of the dish, or stars in this case. The whipped cream too was one of the few good ones I have tried, with\u00a0perfect consistency.\nAs they also serve quick bites on display, we decided to try the Sesame Seed Bagel (Rs. 200). It was quite alright. We loved the cheesy outer crust which tasted great, but it was harder than we expected. It took all our energy to slice it in half. The inside of it was much smoother and tasted like, well, bread.\nVishvi had a gift certificate for a free chocolate cake from her previous visit so we got to try their signature Chocolate Bliss (Rs. 580) as well. I'm running out of words to describe how good it too was. You can probably see from the picture the thick layers of pure decadent chocolate that was lathered in between the cake. It was not overwhelmingly sweet but very chocolatey and as the name suggests, pure bliss.\nAside from the matcha, there was nothing native to Japanese cuisine. They have the usual coffee, tea, fresh juices, smoothies, frappes, milkshakes and soft drinks.\nThe Iced Matcha Frappe (Rs. 730) was really good. Of course\u00a0it didn't have the strong bitter taste of a normal matcha but there was still a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. It was filling and refreshing on a hot sunny day.\nOkay, here's where it gets really frustrating. The Cappuccino (Rs. 420) we got was utterly terrible. It was bland and watery with barely any scent of coffee. While they do have other alternative beverages on the menu, a cafe should be able to produce a decent cup of coffee. We really hope they improve on this immediately.\nTheir service was one of the best we have received with the\u00a0friendliest staff who were very attentive. All of them were well-versed and professional.\u00a0Our food was served within minutes which was impressive.\nThe place is spacious, cozy and relaxing. There are enough couches for you to peacefully get your work done, with plenty of natural light. At the same time, they also have wooden chairs and tables to properly sit down for a meal.\nIn short, we love Tokiwa. Their food is exceptionally good and I can see myself going back pretty soon. The coffee, however, needs a massive improvement.\nA Japanese inspired cafe that does an excellent Omurice.\n\n\u0dc3\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca\u200d\u0dba \u0d9a\u0dd0\u0dc6\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0db8\u0dc0\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0db8\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dcf, \u0da2\u0dd0\u0db4\u0db1\u0dd3\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dad\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0db8 \u0da7\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca \u0d9a\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0dc4\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dd4\u0dab\u0ddc\u0dad\u0dca \u0da7\u0ddc\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dcf \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda \u0d91\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3 \u0db8 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca.\n",
