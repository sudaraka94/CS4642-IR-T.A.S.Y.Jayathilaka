  "reviews": "We dropped into Kumbuk Kitchen to check them out a month ago. Being meat-loving omnivores, we were suitably impressed with their veg-friendly dishes the first time around, and the second time around as well. Health foods are all the blaze in Colombo right now what with even your regular\nbeing chilled and sold for over double its prices, and the trend's continuing to grow.\nMy orders were processed quickly and I was informed that the food would take about 10 minutes, which wasn't an issue. My Flat White was brought to the table within a few minutes, and then I settled down for a read until the salad and Grain Bowl made its way. It's a nice place to while the time away, especially if you want to be in the middle of Colombo but out of the traffic and crowds and all that.\nGiven that the space hasn't changed at all, it's still very homely and feels like you're visiting a friend's\nfor a\u00a0t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. The servers comes to check on you at frequent intervals, and are generous with refilling table water \u2014\nplus point because it's such a turn-off when restaurants insist on you always buying a bottle.\nDropping in for breakfast, I opted for a Thai Mango Salad (Rs. 500) and a Grain Bowl (Rs. 600). You get your value for money, especially in terms of quantity and quality of the food dished up here. The mango salad was super zesty and flavoursome, with the fruit being fresh and just ever so slightly raw, so it gave a nice acidic kick that went well with the peanuts and sliced bell peppers thrown in. It also had some lovely tortilla chips thrown in.\nThe Grain Bowl comes with bits of oranges and cucumber tossed in a bowl full of millet seeds. (Fun fact: if that sounds familiar, and you know about or own birds, it's because it's also quite popular for birdseed). It's garnished with fried and sliced ash plantains, which added a nice crunch to it. Again, large portions, and if you're super into health foods, this should sate your hunger. I personally found the flavours a tad too subtle for my taste, but can see it working for others.\nI found the coffee enjoyable, not as strong or aromatic as what I'd like, but then again I opted for a Flat White (Rs. 450) so can't really complain. It was nice though, and breakfast there was enhanced by the fact that (a) it didn't have a lot of noisy people and (b) the staff are really friendly and helpful.\nMy dining experience was good here, even though I'm not a vegetarian. It's great to drop in for breakfast or if you're waiting around for someone. The staff are friendly, it's leafy and green, plus the Good Market shop is right there as well\u00a0if you'd like to buy some organic groceries.\nA vegan and vegetarian Kumbuk outlet with good service.\nCafe Kumbuk's local, seasonal and organic healthy food gets a second outlet at the Good Market shop.\n",
