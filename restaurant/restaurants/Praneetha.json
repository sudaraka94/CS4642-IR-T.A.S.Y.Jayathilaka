  "reviews": "Praneetha, a previous hole-in-the-wall\nhas now become a slightly pish posh\nwith A/C and less stuffy seating space. But is it still a 5 star\nspot?\nWe dropped in on a Tuesday afternoon for a quick lunch to find out.\nWith good air conditioning comes slight price hikes. We got a Chicken Rice and Curry for Rs 200, an increment since our past visit but it still manages to be on par with the\u00a0standard price for a basic rice and curry. We also ordered a\u00a0Seafood Fried Rice priced at a whopping Rs 600. Never in my life have I\u00a0ever\u00a0paid so much for fried rice at a\n.\nThe portion of rice and curry came with the customary mountain of rice, accompanied by curries of the likes of\u00a0dhal, mango,\n(jack fruit), chicken, of course, and a gotukola sambol. Despite finding the dhal a little too salty, the rice and curry made for a good portion\u00a0with the\u00a0spicy chicken curry mingling well with the much-loved combo of the mellow\nand tangy mango. It was standard\u00a0and satisfying.\nWe were made to wait for over 15\u00a0minutes for this ginormous Seafood Fried Rice. While Rs 600 is too much by ANY\nstandards (with A/C or without) this could have been easily shared between 2 people (or among 3 carb-conscious people). There were plenty of cuttlefish rings, prawns, pieces of fish and deep fried crab which had a soft crunch and tasted great.\u00a0Overall, it was good, but just not great. Had it been spicier and a little less dry, it would have been a solid fried rice.\nWhile other spots have unlimited\nPraneetha does a healthier take and offers unlimited slices of cucumber and leaves of lettuce. There's a tray full of deep-fried chilies too, for that extra kick.\nWant to witness a Lankan version of Gordon Ramsay? Head to Praneetha during noon on a busy weekday. The man behind the counter is constantly screaming out orders and comments with a dose of annoyance\u00a0to his masked elves. Makes for good entertainment if you low-key love drama.\nPraneetha seems to be a popular lunch spot\u00a0for office staff around the area. We walked in at about 11.50 am to a room full of lunch-deprived men and women. But it's mostly seen as a takeaway spot\u00a0rather than dine-in, but the new location does have seating for about 10-15 people.\nThey've also got a huge frame that would remind you of what an Island lad/lass you are as you work your way through your rice and curry.\nAs is the case with most places, with expansion, there seems to be a slight drop in their quality. But they still stand as\u00a0a reliable option for a good\u00a0Lankan lunch if you're around the area.\nFrom a hole-in-the-wall to an A/C buth kadey!\nPraneetha is a little hole in the wall buth kade that serves up a great rice and curry with the option of every kind of meat, from prawns to pork.\n\n\u0dc4\u0db4\u0dca\u0db4\u0da0\u0dca\u0da0\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dda! \u0db1\u0db6\u0dd3\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0d9c\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad \u0dc3\u0dd3\u0dc6\u0dd4\u0da9\u0dca \u0dc6\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dba\u0dd2\u0da9\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dba\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a\u0dda \u0dad\u0dd2\u0db6\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dc5\u0dd4 \u0da2\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0dad\u0ddc\u0d9c\u0dda! \u0dad\u0da9\u0dd2 \u0d89\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0ddd, \u0dbd\u0ddc\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0da7 \u0d9a\u0db4\u0db4\u0dd4 \u0daf\u0dd0\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd\u0ddd \u0dbb\u0dc0\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca, \u0db6\u0dd0\u0daf\u0db4\u0dd4 \u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dc5\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0dc3\u0dca, \u0dad\u0dbd\u0db4\u0dad\u0dca \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dc5\u0dd4 \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0dbd\u0ddd\u0db6 \u0db1\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dd4\u0dc0 \u0db8\u0dda\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0daf\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0dad\u0dd2\u0db6\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf.\n",
