  "description": "Ginger's a small Bistro that offers a mix of Asian Flavours. They've got a cozy space with some nice curry dishes, but are also quite pricey.",
  "reviews": "Ginger is a chic little restaurant nestled next to Jagro in Dharmapala Mawatha. It's multi-cuisine and has a menu comprising of sandwiches, pastas, soups and salads. They also play acoustic music on Tuesdays.\nWe dropped by on a sunny Thursday afternoon, and found the white and ochre theme quite refreshing. It's minimalistic, and they've utilised the space they have well, without making it feel overcrowded or stuffy.\nThe acoustics of the place are\u00a0weird though \u2014 sound reverberates a\n, so the thrum of the blender, the playlist they had going, and people's voices just kept echoing and escalating. Kavindu and I found the music very distracting because of how you could only hear the bass and not much of anything else. Noise aside, the space is great.\nThey've also got a couple of outdoor options, the deck right in front and then a more secluded area in the back, strung up with little bulbs; so I assume it'd look lovely at night.\nA server came over and helped us over to our seats from the second we stepped in, followed shortly by the menu. I wish this was an indication of how prompt their service is, but unfortunately it turned out quite slow: we ordered at 1:40 and got soup twenty minutes later with the mains eventually making their way over\u00a020 minutes after even that. We basically ended up waiting about 40 minutes, such sadness.\nThankfully we got our drinks relatively early, and Kavindu loved his Pineapple juice (Rs. 350). My Passion Punch (Rs. 450) was a passionfruit incarnate, sourness and all. It was immensely tangy and outright sour, but tasted pretty great once I poured in about half of the sugar syrup that accompanied both drinks.\nOur soup exceeded expectations by delivering a perfect albeit confusing concoction of ginger, carrot, and orange. That's incidentally the name of the soup as well - Ginger, Carrot and Orange Soup. It comes with two tiny bits of amazing toast: buttered and garnished with herbs to perfection, crispy, and still warm. Not a bad deal for Rs. 450 at all.\nOur Pasta with Creamy Cheese and Mushroom was a nice, large portion, but was at room temperature. For something that took nearly an hour to reach us, we were looking forward to a nice, warm meal but nope. That said, it had a generous bit of mushroom in it, though the pasta itself was overcooked and too soft and soggy for our liking. It wasn't overpriced at Rs. 850, what with pastas around the city costing much more, but we can't really say this was satisfactory.\nThe Grilled Chicken with Mushroom (Rs. 980) came with a humungous side of mash and a lovely salad peppered with pickled gherkins. This looks great until you actually dig into it, whereupon you discover that the salad is 90% lettuce leaves with a mere topping of chopped bell peppers, gherkins, and vinaigrette.\nI shan't dwell too long on this, but the chicken was quite tough \u2014 almost like it had been fried for a while \u2014 and stringy.\nNone of their desserts were available, which was a pity.\nWith our total coming just over Rs. 3500, we can't say we were satisfied with our meal. Props to friendly service and a lovely space to while your time away, but where food is concerned...nah.\nLovely ambience, slow food.\nWe tried Ginger again. Their prices are the same, but their portion size has increased.\n",
