  "reviews": "For the past few months, the restaurant scene in the suburbs of Dehiwala - Mount Lavinia area has been on a skyrocket. A bunch of new spots have opened up, and us foodies couldn\u2019t be happier. Double Cheese Coffee & Dine on\u00a0Hill Street is one such restaurant, that\u00a0we stumbled across\u00a0wholly by accident.\nThe menu at Double Cheese Coffee & Dine is quite extensive, so you\u2019ll have a lot to choose from. They serve a range of burgers, submarines, kottu, rice-centred\u00a0specialties, pasta, lasagna\u00a0and even pizza. They also do rice and curry for lunch and at Rs. 250 a packet, they\u2019re only available for take away. As for drinks, they\u2019ve got coffee, tea, milkshakes, smoothies and fresh juices.\nWe ordered a portion of\u00a0Seafood Fried Rice (Rs. 450 for S),\u00a0a plate of Hot Butter Cuttlefish (Rs. 700) and\u00a0Creamy Penne Pasta with Chicken (Rs. 400).\nThe seafood fried rice was absolutely delicious. The\u00a0Basmati rice was cooked well, properly seasoned and not too oily. It had plenty of cuttlefish and prawns tossed in with pieces of eggs, carrots, and spring onions. For couple more hundred bucks\u00a0you can get the large portion of this rice. The small one was easily sharable between two people.\nThe hot butter cuttlefish was a tad salty for my taste. It was crunchy, chewy,\u00a0adequately spiced and flavoursome, but tasted like a re-fried and not freshly made. This is not the worst HBC, but we\u2019ve had better.\nPerfectly cooked penne pasta with decadently creamy texture, this dish was our instant favourite. It was garnished with bell pepper, which didn\u2019t do much to the flavour but added colour to the dish. Although we\u2019d prefer more minced chicken on this,\u00a0it was still super delish. It came with a side of toasted bread.\nFor drinks, we got a Dark Chocolate Latte (Rs. 400) and a Falooda (Rs. 390). The latte was\u00a0very chocolatey\u00a0and had a rich coffee flavour that comes through the fluffy foamy milk.\nThe falooda on the other hand was slightly too sweet, but had the other basic elements in the right balance. Topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and sprinkled with\n(poppy seeds), this is a good thirst quencher to beat the heat.\nThe staff at Double Cheese Coffee & Dine is very attentive and friendly. They\u2019re more than happy to assist you to choose the best food that goes with your appetite. Our food and drinks took around 15 minutes to arrive, which is impressive considering the large number of customers they had in the restaurant at the peak hour.\nWe liked the ambience here. It\u2019s spacious enough to comfortably accommodate at least thirty customers and has a pleasant vibe. According to the manager, the restaurant gets booked all the time for birthday parties and family dinners.\nIt\u2019s been only 5 - 6 months since their opening but as we could see, it has already become the crowd\u2019s favourite. They\u2019re affordable, tasty and efficient, so if you\u2019re around Dehiwala area looking for a good meal within a budget, this is just the place to be.\nDouble Cheese Coffee & Dine on Hill Street serves up some good food for a reasonable cost.\n\n\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd9\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0db4\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dda \u0d85\u0db4\u0da7 \u0dbd\u0dd0\u0db6\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4 \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3\u0db8 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dda \u0d85\u0dad\u0dca\u0daf\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dd3\u0db8\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0da7, \u0da9\u0db6\u0dbd\u0dca \u0da0\u0dd3\u0dc3\u0dca \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0dc6\u0dd3 \u0d87\u0db1\u0dca\u0da9\u0dca \u0da9\u0dba\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0db8 \u0dc0\u0dda\u0dbd \u0dc4\u0db3\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0db4\u0dd4\u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca.\n",
