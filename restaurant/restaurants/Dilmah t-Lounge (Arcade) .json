  "reviews": "We loved Dilmah t-Lounge, especially for their utterly refreshing and cooling drinks. The drinks are still good, but the service is possibly the worst you can get in Colombo \u2014 Arcade's branch couldn't do worse if they tried.\nDilmah's breezy flavoured teas are exquisite. Light, tangy, and infused with just the right amount of flavour and a tad too much sugar (especially unstirred), it's a cooling slice of heaven on a sweltering day. We love our authentic cup of strong strained tea, but sometimes, just sometimes, it's nice to have tea with a twist.\nWe preferred the Moroccan Iced Mint Tea over our Blueberry and Pomegranate, mostly because the latter was a lot sweeter and less subtle. The Moroccan, infused with slivers of lime and fresh mint leaves balanced sweetness and acidity perfectly. The execution is simple, and delivers what it promises. We loved it.\nPriced the same as the Moroccan (at Rs. 350), the Blueberry and Pomegranate was a tad more saccharine though the combination wasn't unpleasant.\nWe say Blueberry and Pomegranate because we were billed for a B&P and the menu says B&P, but what we got was a pink drink infused and topped off with strawberries.\n. We double checked the menu after returning back to office,\nacquiring the aforementioned beverages was a task in itself. It involved numerous instances of waving around and calling out to get the waitstaff's attention to place our order. We also asked for some food alongside it (a couple of waffles and one of their speciality burgers), and the ice-cream on the menu. They didn't have the flavour requested, so we settled for something else. The waiter hesitated, disappeared, and then reappeared again \u2014 that flavour was unavailable as well. Forever persistent, we picked something else with a fleeting sense of deja vu. Which wasn't unjustified, because of course it was unavailable. Ah well, 15 minutes later, we resigned ourselves to having just the food and drink and waited for it. One hour.\nNow to the food. At Rs. 640, my Chicken Burger was worth its price. Stuffed high with juicy pulled chicken, this teetered between sweet and savoury and was practically dripping around the edges. Cheesy, meaty goodness.\nWhile the burger topped expectations, Dilina's Ham and Cheese Waffle's only redeeming factor was the cheese on it. The ham (chicken) was quite tasteless, and the waffle itself was unremarkable. Slightly rubbery, un-fluffy, and uninspiring; definitely not worth the 690 rupees we dumped for this.\nSuprisingly, Kavindu's waffle topped with Grilled Vegetables With Herbs and Olive Oil was a satisfying sight. Best of all, it was great for a vegetarian meal: fresh, crisp vegs, spicy bell peppers, lots of contrasting colours and flavours. Yes, it's expensive at Rs. 660, but what isn't expensive these days?\nDilmah -Lounge is a study in unapologetic inefficiency. Not only do they manage to mix orders up, they also maintain high standards of consistency when it comes down to forgetting orders and then being completely unabashed by it.\nThe first time around we just shrugged it off (and they saw our cameras and apologised when they thought we were from the media) but the second time around was just too terrible to not mention here.\nThe orders took a whole hour to arrive, and were wrong to boot. Most of the food, even thereafter, didn't arrive. Meanwhile, we'd been asking for it the whole while and the waitstaff kept walking out mid-sentence when we were talking to them, or kept saying it's on its way (it wasn't, they had forgotten).\nIn the end I had to go up to the counter and ask for the bill for whatever eventually made its way to our table, and even this resulted in utter confusion and took a total of about 15 minutes.\nMe: Hi, we didn't get our orders and would like to cancel the rest. We've been here for an hour.\nDilmah: Ah.\ncheck. You asked for these?\nMe: Yes, over an hour ago?\nDilmah: Okay. *fifteen minutes later* Here's the bill.\nCuriously, there were literally\npeople behind the counter mixing and shaking drinks up (\ntoo before serving) in the midst of completely forgetting about and ignoring a group of customers who were sitting in plain sight and gesticulating wildly in failed attempts to get some attention (and tea).\nGo elsewhere.\nWe've loved Dilmah t-Lounge, especially for their utterly refreshing and cooling drinks but their service has gone to the dogs.\nDilmah t-Lounge at the Arcade is pretty similar to their outlet in Chatham Street. The food is good, and the space is less crowded and the service is better - though you get less privacy because of the big glass windows.\n\n\u0db8\u0dd9\u0dad\u0db1 \u0dc3\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a \u0da0\u0dcf\u0da7\u0dbb\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1 \u0d91\u0d9a \u0d85\u0dbd\u0dd4\u0dad\u0dca \u0daf\u0dd9\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db1\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dd9\u0dba\u0dd2. \u0d89\u0dad\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0db8\u0dda\u0d9a \u0dad\u0dc0 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0db6\u0dbd\u0dcf\u0db4\u0ddc\u0dbb\u0ddc\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad\u0dd4 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0d91\u0d9a\u0dda \u0dc0\u0dd0\u0da9\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dc0\u0daf \u0db8\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf.\n",
