  "reviews": "More commonly known as Vani Vilas, Shri Vani Vilas has been around for a couple of generations and has a reputation for being one of the best\u2014if not\n\u2014saivars around. They have a huge range of food\u00a0on offer, from your regular\nand\n, to more elaborate dishes such as the tandoori platter, mushroom pepper fry, and Lucknowi dum biryani. The staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and make you feel right at home.\nThere is\u00a0an upstairs and downstairs section. The\u00a0downstairs is your regular, fast-paced\nwhich is perfect for the working crowd in a hurry, while\u00a0the upstairs is more like a proper restaurant for families and kids. We dined upstairs, in the airconditioned restaurant.\nTheir staff are warm\u2014like people you've known for ages\u2014while also being professional.\u00a0They are caring and concerned about\u00a0whether you enjoyed the food,\u00a0and also urge you to tuck into some of the dishes while they are still hot.\u00a0(They were also keen on helping me with photographing the food).\nNow, to get down to the food. We began our meal with regular fare like the\nand ghee roast.\nThis vadai (Rs. 60) \u00a0is hands down one of the best I've tried. There are\u00a0few places that get this fluffy doughball right.\u00a0Vani Villas hits the spot by frying the\nto crisp, golden perfection. Piping hot, the\nwas soft and moist on the insides and wonderful to bite into.\nThe ghee roast (Rs. 240)\u00a0was beautifully presented, but slighty doughy on the inside and not up to the standard of the crispy thin\u00a0ghee roast at\n.\nThe hot and sour soup\u00a0looked\u00a0intensely spicy, but it was lacking in heat. It also had an off-putting consistency, having been thickened with corn flour.\u00a0It wasn't bad overall, and fragnant from the leeks and bits of herbs that had been added to it, but it didn't live up to its name either.\nTheir honey chilli potatoes were a bit of a surprise because we were expecting potatoes and got fries instead.\u00a0But the caramelised and lightly syrupy fries sprinkled with chilli powder and chopped spring onion greens, made the dish very interesting.\nGarnished with a generous sprinkling of sesame seeds, this was a taste that grew on you with every bite.\nThe Lucknow Dum Biryani was surprisingly good as well, with fragrant grains of basmati rice and fried onions on top.\u00a0It almost melted in your mouth, and was packed with subtle flavour.\nThis was good, but everything paled in comparision to the Tandoori Platter, which at a mere Rs. 650 was the most expensive dish of the day.\u00a0Presented on a sizzling and spluttering platter, it came as a very pleasant surprise.\nIt was generously laden with paneer (both tandoori and non-tandoori grilled paneer), and a plethora of fruits and greens (tangy pineapple, bell peppers, broccoli and lettuce).\nAll of them were grilled just right \u2014 charred perfectly on the outside, and moist and soft inside.\u00a0I'm no paneer expert,\u00a0but that tandoori paneer was the best I've ever had. The stewards were kind enough to show me how to cut it up as well, although I'm sure I would have succeeded if I had tried it myself\u00a0\u00a0:D\nI was almost about to give Vani Vilas\u00a0a five-star rating, had it not been for the soup and the overly sweet drinks we tried.\u00a0This little restaurant whips up some amazing food in its unlikely location on\u00a0busy and heavily industrialized Armour Street. It's a little jewel in that area, and well-worth visiting.\n",
