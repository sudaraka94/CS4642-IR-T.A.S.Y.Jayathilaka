There's just this small issue of having to empty your wallet for a few scoops..\nThis place serves very good ice-cream and, unusually for SL, has maintained high standards for over a decade.\u00a0 The cream-based chocolate and nut flavours are particularly excellent (I recommend Dark chocolate, Hazelnut and Pistachio) while the lighter more sorbet-consistency fruit flavours(go for passion fruit and fruits of the forest) are sharp and refreshing.\nWe've had quite a few new ice cream parlors pop up over the past few years (no complaints from us!), but Il Gelato still reigns supreme when it comes to high quality ice cream.
