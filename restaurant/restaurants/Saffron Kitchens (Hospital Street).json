  "reviews": "Hospital Street is slowly becoming one of my favourite streets. Even though it's infected with gross, shady catcallers and back alley bargainers for foreign currency it hosts some of the coolest new places to dine here in CMB. They also deliver, so give them a call on\u00a00117664466 for orders.\nThey serve up a mean rice and curry lunch with a range of interesting side options. What's great is the fact that they serve both red and white rice and a range of fresh, homemade-style curries like gotukala, pollos, sizeable and well cooked portions of fish or chicken, and some crispy poppadoms on the side. Also shoutout to the biriyani offer they've got going on every Fridays for Rs. 225.\nCheck their\nfor their Kidu giveaways and updates on new dishes. They've even got dishes like Dum Biriyani, Ghee rice, Nasi Goreng etc on order.\nThe chicken\u00a0rice packet we got cost us Rs. 210 which in my opinion, is a great price. They also serve Fish Rice (Rs.200), Egg Rice (Rs. 160) and\u00a0Vegetable Rice (Rs. 160) respectively.\n\nThey've put up a little flyer advertising sweet treats that are for sale as well from Eclairs to Chocolate Biscuit Pudding to Wattalapam. I'll be honest,\n, but the stuff sold here is actually quite tasty with a big hit of chocolate. It wasn't too synthetic, the cream was fresh and at Rs. 100 it's a helluva deal.\nWhen we went in I saw that they had a few short eats up for grabs mainly samosas, rolls and the like but what interested me was that they had rather full-sized submarine sandwiches as well. I was told that their breakfast menu consists mostly of sandwiches and short-eats so perhaps they'll have a larger variety in the mornings.\n\nSince it was lunch time, the place was chock full of white collar personnel bustling about with their plates full of buth. The cafe seems small but it'll easily seat 20+ people thanks to the genius idea of putting up communal dining tables and sticking to the true buth kade spirit.\nThe place is clean, the large tables by the counter are blocky and enough for about 10 people to sit at. They've also got solo counters for you introverts, and the entrance area has your basic table-chair party going on.\nThe furniture is all warm toned orange and yellow which basically reminded me of..well..Saffron. They've got a funky mini-bar type thing going on but they haven't opened that section up yet so I'll be looking forward to seeing what they'll do with that later.\nAll in all a great place to get a packet of rice at, the food's fresh, the chicken is delicious, the customers seem to love it. The office vegetarian says he enjoyed it, too.\u00a0Would recommend especially if you're on a budget and are hungry for some good and honest local food.\n",
