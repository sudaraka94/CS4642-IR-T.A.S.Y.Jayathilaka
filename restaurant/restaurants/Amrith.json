  "description": "Amrith has moved to a new location. The food is still consistent and while they aren't the best in town, they're still a valid option for Indian food.",
  "reviews": "Amrith's move\u00a0was a good excuse to review the restaurant once again.\nThey recently relocated to De Fonseka road in lieu of Qbaa. The new place is spacious. So spacious, it looked empty when we visited it\u00a0for lunch this week. We assume (and hope) Amrith\u00a0is busier at dinner time. If any of you has an input about that, please let us know, we're curious.\nQuite baffled by the lack of crowd, we hesitantly ordered some food and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of it. While it won't blow your mind away, we can safely say Amrith\u00a0has been\u00a0serving some decent\u00a0Indian food over the years.\nPuzzled by their substantial yet coherent menu, we asked the waiter for recommendations so we could\u00a0have a good overview of their food.\nWe blindly followed his advice\u00a0and ended up with a Chicken Biryani (Rs. 990), Chicken Tikka Masala (Rs. 800), Veg Kolapuri (Rs. 490) and Butter Naans (Rs. 160). The dishes were almost equally tasty,\u00a0spicy and filling. It was definitely enough for the two of us, we couldn't even finish it all.\nLet's start with the\u00a0chicken biryani, the crowd\u00a0favourite. It was good. The rice was fragrant and flavoursome. The gently spiced chicken was well cooked: it was tender and falling off the bone. All in all, the chicken biryani was delicate and not greasy, which we appreciated.\nWe tried another classic, the chicken tikka masala. Here again, nothing to complain about, the dish was properly executed.\u00a0The chicken was tender and moist.\u00a0And the creamy gravy\u00a0was rich and well balanced in terms of herbs and spices.\nThe\u00a0veg kolapuri was a bit behind though. Not that it was a bad dish but the flavours, texture and spices weren't quite there. The gravy was not as smooth and creamy as the chicken tikka masala, and was heavier on oil and spices. Not the best pick but still alright.\n\nThe butter naans did not disappoint us. They were fresh, light and generously buttery. Can't really ask for more!\nTo accompany our meal, we went for a cup of Masala Tea (Rs. 300). I couldn't\u00a0resist trying it when it was on the menu.\u00a0It was definitely worth the price given that there was more than enough of the spicy beverage for two. I would rate it as a good, honest, masala tea. A lot of flavours and spices were going on in the cup and the expected spice\u00a0kick was present. It was a bit too sweet to my taste but yet again I'm not that much of a sweet tooth.\nAs I mentioned, Amrith was uninvitingly empty the day we visited it. Needless to say that the ambience\u00a0was\u00a0not as\u00a0lively as it used to be on a Friday night at\u00a0Qbaa.\u00a0You would probably love the ambience if you are agoraphobic though.\nWhile the location is new, Amrith\u00a0still displays their same old Indian influenced theme. Some paintings and plants here and there and comfy chairs at the entrance\u00a0create\u00a0somehow a homely atmosphere.\u00a0Bonus point for their copper dishes and water cups which I've found pretty nice\u00a0and original.\nService at Amrith\u00a0was effective and pleasant.\u00a0Our food and drinks were served in a timely manner. The staff was discreet and\u00a0cordial.\nApart from the\u00a0new location, nothing really new. All in all, Amrith\u00a0remains a safe choice\u00a0for decent classic Indian food at a reasonable price.\nGood old Amrith has been part of the Indian restaurant scene in Colombo for a while now. It's a fair option to satisfy an Indian food craving, price and taste wise.\nAmriths down Vajira Road is one of the many Indian restaurants in Colombo. The food won\u2019t blow your mind, but it\u2019ll probably be better than you expected.\n\n\u0d89\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca \u0d85\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc4\u0dbd\u0dca \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0dc5\u0db9 \u0db7\u0ddd\u0da2\u0db1 \u0d9a\u0dbd\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0dda \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0db0\u0dcf\u0db1 \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0da7\u0dc3\u0d9a\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda. \u0d92 \u0db1\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dcf \u0d85\u0db4\u0dd2 \u0d91\u0dba \u0d86\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dab\u0dba \u0d9a\u0dc5 \u0dba\u0dd4\u0dad\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dda. \u0d92 \u0db1\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dcf \u0d85\u0db4\u0dd2 \u0db4\u0da7\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9c\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad\u0dcf \u0d85\u0db8\u0dca\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0dad\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca. \u0dc4\u0dd0\u0dc0\u0dca\u0dbd\u0ddc\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db4\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dad\u0dca, \u0dc0\u0da2\u0dd2\u0dbb \u0db4\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dad\u0dca \u0d85\u0dad\u0dbb \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd\u0dda \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dc4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dd2 \u0d91\u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1 \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dbd\u0dca \u0dc4\u0dcf \u0daf\u0dd3\u0db4\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0d8b\u0dad\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dc0 \u0daf\u0dc0\u0dc3\u0d9a \u0db1\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dc3\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dc0\u0d9c\u0dda \u0d86\u0dbd\u0ddd\u0d9a\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca.\n",
