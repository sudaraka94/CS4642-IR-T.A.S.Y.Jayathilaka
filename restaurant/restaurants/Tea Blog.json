  "description": "The newest bubble tea joint in Colombo. They also do cakes, burgers, waffles and sandwiches.",
  "reviews": "Located down Baseline Road, Tea Blog is the latest bubble tea spot in town. Apart from bubble tea, they serve\u00a0up a range of sandwiches, burgers, baguettes, waffles, and sandwiches.\nThey have three types of bubble tea; Fruity tea, Milk tea, and Tea Blog Specials. We tried one of each.\nThe Lovers Paradise (Rs. 400) in their signature range didn't impress us. Originally, it was supposed to come with rose petal black tea, basil seeds and popping boba.\u00a0But as\u00a0there\u00a0was a shortage of popping boba, they were kind enough to replace it with some preserved strawberries.\nThe bits of thinly sliced strawberries floating around\u00a0were a nice touch, but we could barely get the tea taste in this. It literally felt\u00a0like drinking a very sugary\nleaving your mouth all sticky.\u00a0Needless to say, we didn't finish this.\nTheir Nutella Waffle (Rs. 600) looked quite messy but we liked it. The waffle itself had a fluffy texture,\u00a0crunchy edges and wasn't crazy-sweet, which worked well with the toppings.\nTopped off with three small scoops of chocolate ice cream, and drizzled with Nutella, it was a very filling snack. Although, we wish it had fresh strawberries, instead of preserved ones.\nWe also tried their\u00a0Chilli Cheese Sandwich (Rs. 350), which was quite alright. The bell pepper and mozzarella\u00a0flavors emerged nicely through the perfectly toasted slices of bread.\nThe interior is decorated with cushioned benches, comfortable chairs, and warm lighting, which has given it the\u00a0glimpse of contemporary elegance. It can easily accommodate 15-20 people at a time.\nTea Blog\u00a0is managed by some of the nicest people you\u2019ll ever meet. They\u2019re very friendly, and attentive but unfortunately, they took around good 40 minutes to deliver our food and drinks to the table. It's highly unacceptable considering there were only four more customers apart from us.\nTea Blog has been around for\u00a08 months now\u00a0and as we could see, it has become a popular spot among the working crowd around this area. Whilst\u00a0they've got some good\u00a0food and drinks, they definitely should work on improving their service.\nA bubble tea spot with some good snacks.\n\n\u0daf\u0dd9\u0db8\u0da7\u0d9c\u0ddc\u0da9 \u0db4\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0d86\u0dc0 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0d9a \u0db6\u0db6\u0dbd\u0dca \u0da7\u0dd3 \u0d91\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db6\u0dd3\u0dbd\u0dcf, \u0db4\u0ddc\u0da9\u0dd2 \u0dc3\u0dca\u0db1\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dc0\u0d9c\u0dda \u0d9a\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0da7\u0dd3 \u0db6\u0dca\u0dbd\u0ddc\u0d9c\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca.\n",
