  "description": "Kottulabs.lk does some good kottu in many interesting ways. You can place your orders through their neat website, and they deliver to your doorstep. ",
  "reviews": "KottuLabs has perfected the art of making kottu that is susceptible to our Sri Lankan palates. While we do love a good old cheese kottu, it's very rare to find a place that does the rest of the varieties as well as that.\nIt's very simple. Head on over to\nand follow the instructions. The best thing about it is that you get to make your own kottu, aside from their signature range. Their pickup address is\u00a0No 31, D.M. Colombage Mawatha, Nawala, Nugegoda.\nThey deliver after 4 p.m and is free of charge to areas within Colombo 1 to 7, Dehiwala, Kohuwala, Nugegoda, Nawala, Rajagiriya and Mount Lavinia.\nTheir menu is not very extensive but they have interesting options like\nand\nThe Beef it Up (Rs. 730) was our favorite. It was mildly spicy with perfect seasoning. There was a lot of beef to go around and the portion\u00a0itself was massive. The kottu was delicious and they haven't skimped on the veggies. The cutlet on top was a nice addition.\nThis was the Create Your Own kottu (Rs. 640) for which we picked paneer with a choice of 4 veggies. Unfortunately, the paneer did not do it for me. I prefer the curry to a grilled paneer because of the flavorful, chewy texture that is easily gained through something like a paneer butter masala, whereas with the grilled paneer the only flavor you can taste is the paneer itself, which isn't very rich.\nThe Devilled Dalla (Rs. 730) was again another winner. It was just the right amount of spiciness with a lot of\u00a0cuttlefish and\n. The cuttlefish was a tad salty for our taste but that could be easily looked.\nYou get a free Sprite bottle with every kottu as well as two gravies. The gravies are good but I would recommend trying the kottu without it first.\nI did not expect the kottu to be this good honestly, so I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised.\nTheir service is excellent! The ordering process is super easy and very simple. They will call you up to confirm the order and the next time you hear from them would be when they're right outside your door. Our food was delivered 30 minutes before the requested time.\nAfter\n, this is probably my favorite kottu joint. The prices are steeper than your average street joint, but the quality and the Sri Lankan twist they have inserted into, undoubtedly give your money's worth.\nI did not expect the kottu to be this good honestly, so I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised.\n\n\u0dc2\u0dd0\u0dc4\u0dca! \u0d85\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0d9a\u0db1\u0dc0 \u0db1\u0db8\u0dca \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad\u0dd4. \u0d86\u0dba\u0dd9 \u0da7\u0ddc\u0db4\u0dca \u0d88\u2026 \u0db6\u0dd0\u0daf\u0db4\u0dd4 \u0db4\u0db1\u0dd3\u0dbb\u0dca, \u0db8\u0dbd\u0dca \u0d9c\u0ddd\u0dc0\u0dcf, \u0dbd\u0dd3\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dca, \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dc5\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca, \u0d9a\u0dd0\u0dbb\u0da7\u0dca \u0dc4\u0db4\u0dca\u0db4\u0dda\u2026 \u0d92 \u0db8\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0da7 \u0dbd\u0ddc\u0d9a\u0dd4 \u0d9a\u0da9\u0dbd \u0d87\u0da7\u0dad\u0dca \u0db1\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db8 \u0d9c\u0dcf\u0db1\u0da7 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db8\u0dca\u0db6\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dcf. \u0dc3\u0dd0\u0dbb \u0d9c\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dad\u0dca \u0d9c\u0dcf\u0db1\u0da7.\n",
