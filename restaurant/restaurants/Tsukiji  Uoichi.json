  "reviews": "Over a year since first opening its doors Tsukiji Uoichi is still going strong. They've got one of the most impressive Japanese menus in Colombo and their\u00a0execution is excellent. Their prices are on the higher end but the food is well worth it and the service is as efficient as it gets.\nThe service at Tsukiji Uoichi is incredibly professional and efficient, on par with the likes of Yumi and Nihonbashi. They know the menu front and back which is an impressive feat considering the selection they offer. Our food was ready quite fast, with each dish following the other.\nThey've kept things pretty simple in terms of ambience which works well with the Japanese cuisine. As you enter you're greeted by the chefs stationed behind the sushi bar, which seats around twelve. The somewhat low wooden chairs with flat cushions were reminiscent of tatami mats, with the large windows letting in plenty of natural light.\nTsukiji Uoichi offers one of the most extensive Japanese menus in Colombo with pretty much any classic Japanese dish you can think of, along with some of their own signature sushi dishes. Prices are on the higher end so expect to pay around Rs. 2500 - Rs. 3000 per head. That being said, considering the quality of the food, efficiency of the service and the location, we felt it was justified.\nOur seven piece nigiri platter (Rs. 1380) came with one each of tuna, salmon, squid, shrimp, tamago, and two shiromi nigiri. With only three real elements (the sushi rice, fish and\u00a0 wasabi), even the slightest of flaws can ruin a nigir. In this case however, both the flavour and presentation was on point. The seafood was fresh, the rice had a great consistency with the subtle falvour of the rice vinegar and the kick of the wasabi coming in at the end. This was ready in less than ten minutes which we really appreciated and it didn't seem rushed since the nigiri was presented beautifully with the fish vibrant seafood draped over the rice.\nWe also tried out the crunchy ebi tempura maki (Rs. 660 for 4). Being one of their specialized sushi offerings, this is pricier than the simple makis, but it's also got a lot more going on. This is an uramaki, with ebi tempura in middle, topped with a crispy rice flakes, a fried curry leaf and a small piece of karage. There's a whole bunch of fried elements in this one so it's got some great textures. This is also good option for those who aren't fans of raw fish. The shrimp was cooked just right with a thin tempura batter adding a light crunch, complemented further by the savouriness of the karage and the curry leaf.\nTheir seafood and pork okonomiyaki (Rs. 880) was presented differently to what we've come across at other spots. They top it with bonito fish flakes which react to the heat of the dish and sway. It's weirdly therapeutic and I found myself just starting at it for like five minutes.\n\n\nFlavourwise the fish flakes add a subtle saltiness and a bit if texture. The pancake itself was rich, with the flavour in\u00a0the egg and seafood coming through beautifully. The pork was mostly lean but still moist, marrying well with the shrimp and calamari.\nThey've also got kushiage (Rs. 230+ each) which is basically deep fried cutlet skewers. We got the prawn, squid and chicken, which came with an interesting fruit based dipping sauce which had a distinct tanginess and sweetness which offsets brilliantly against the savoury cutlets.\nThe skewers come piping hot and the sauce is served cold which creates a nice contrast of temperatures.\nIt's been a while, but our lunch at Tsukiji Ouichi went about without hiccup. They were the only establishment with customers at the otherwise deserted Arcade Independence Square and it's no surprise. It doesn't happen often but we're bumping them up to five stars.\nOver a year since first opening its doors Tsukiji Uoichi is still going strong. They've got one of the most impressive Japanese menus in Colombo and they're execution is excellent. Their prices are on the higher end but the food is well worth it and the service is as efficient as it gets.\nThe Arcade Independence Square is a melting pot of new and ambitious projects. One such establishment many have been asking about, is the new Japanese restaurant- Tsukiji Uoichi. They offer pretty much any quintessential Japanese dish you can think of, and for the most part they do it quite well, falling in the mid range of pricing between the likes of Nihonbashi at the higher-end and Sakura at the lower.\n\n\u0d89\u0db3\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0dc4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0dc4\u0dbb\u0dd2 \u0da2\u0dd0\u0db4\u0db1\u0dd3\u0dc3\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0db8 \u0db6\u0da9\u0d9c\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca \u0d86\u0dc0\u0ddc\u0dad\u0dca \u0d89\u0dad\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0db8\u0dda\u0d9a \u0db1\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db8 \u0db4\u0ddc\u0da7\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a.\n",
