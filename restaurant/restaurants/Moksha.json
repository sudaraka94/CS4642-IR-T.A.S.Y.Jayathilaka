  "reviews": "Moksha serves a wide range of Indian food (such as North Indian snacks and Delhi\u00a0Chaat, a range of breads, rice dishes and even quirky things like a Paneer Burger). It also features\u00a0a respectabe range of sweets (their speciality is the kulfi) that seem great value for money.\u200b\nLocated near to the end of Duplication Rd, Moksha\u00a0screams at you with its light-blue themed branding. Parking is tough to find along this stretch of the road, so be warned.\nDespite the tacky decor, the food is presented really well. More importantly, the food tasted\u00a0pretty good too.\nWe started with some chaat. The Dahi Puri (Rs. 350) and Aloo Samosa (Rs. 250), both were well worth the money and could have been full meals in and of themselves.\nBoth of them wavered on the sweet side, with no choice being offered to make them spicy, which is normal procedure when it comes to chaat. We added some spicy sauce into them, but it honestly didn't do much.\nNext we went for the thali (Rs. 1250), great value for money. It came with aloo paratha,\u00a0mushroom mutter, paneer masala and dhal makani, with a generous helping of vegetable biryani. The parata was excellent and contained a generous dose of spicy potatoes on the inside.\u00a0The curries weren't too spicy and complemented each other really well.\nThe vegetable biryani, a little bland in the begining, soon acquired taste\u00a0and spice as it was mixed in with the curries. The thali came with a set of solid pickles and other accompaniments such as raita and papadum and the glass of buttermilk was\u00a0just\u00a0sour enough to taste good without being offputting.\nIt also comes with gulab jamun (the sauce was a little too sweet) and almond\u00a0barfi (which was good). The thali is easily enough for two.\nNote that if you're a big fan of curry, and like to ladle it on in juicy quantities to eat with your parata or rice, then the quantity provided in the thali might be just south of sufficient.\nThe Kulfi here is some of the most heavily marketed I have encountered. A huge LCD screen treats you to a 'making-of' video on this North Indian ice-cream-esque sweet on loop, to a soundtrack of Shah Rukh Kahn hits. We had to try it. Note: we went back the next day because space constraints in the belly.\nThey sell Kulfi to walk-in customers, in little packets (from Rs. 100) to little clay pots (Rs. 450 onwards depending on the flavor), which was the classic packaging the maharajahs would eat it out of. The quantity isn't huge, and you can probably buy much more ice-cream for the same price, but for the same prices as a couple of scoops of decent ice-cream from a decent deli, the kulfi offers you a taste sensation that is hard to find anywhere else here in SL.\nThat being, said, it didn't come off as being the best. All of the flavors we tried had something missing. The Roasted Almond something I\u00a0couldn't quite put my finger on, but it lingered after i'd swallowed, driving me nuts. The Matka Kesar Almond Pistachio was much better, but perhaps a tad too much cardamom in it? It was my favourite though. The Mango Maaza was a little to soft and gooey, and the mango tasted a little artificial.\nI'd suggest sticking to the traditional spice and nuts based flavors and stay away from the fruity ones (they have a range going from mangoostein to rambutan).\nThe ambience inside is mystifyingly quirky. The chairs and tables are of varying different styles and shapes, like it was all put together from an\u00a0auction or garage sale.\u00a0Our table even had a drawer (in case you want to keep bits of food inside for later?)\nThe decor was similarly eclectic. Wooden Sigiri tapestry replicas clash with\u00a0nineties birthday party decor, all while bright\u00a0peices of cotton adorn every surface in celebration of christmas.\nIn one corner there was an 'art gallery'\u00a0full of kids' artwork.\u00a0Right below them a set of large trash cans were\u00a0passing all sorts of passive aggressive and not so constructive critique on\u00a0the art of these poor kids.\nThe staff are efficient, but surprisingly also, very shy. Questions had to be repeated and they gave us goggle eyes when one of us rolled a cigarette. The payment system is pay-before-you-eat. You order your food and then pay at the counter, cafeteria style.\nMoksha serves a lot of Indian food, highlights being the chaat and thali.\u00a0\u00a0The ambience doesn't exactly inspire a calm and sophisticated feeling, but if you're only here to stuff your face, I\u00a0am sure you can let that go.\nMoksha serves a wide range of Indian food (such as North Indian snacks and Delhi\u00a0Chaat, a range of breads, rice dishes and even quirky things like a Paneer Burger).\nIt is a great place for your Indian dessert cravings.\n\n\u0dc4\u0dd2\u0dad \u0d9c\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dda \u0db8\u0ddd\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dcf \u2018\u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0ddd\u0db1\u0dca \u0db6\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dd2\u2019 \u0d91\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0dc0\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf\u0da7 \u0db8\u0ddc\u0d9a\u0daf \u0dc0\u0dda\u0da7\u0dbb\u0dca \u0db8\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0d9c\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0d85\u0dc4\u0dbd \u0db6\u0dd0\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0db8\u0dca \u0d92\u0dc0\u0dcf \u0d9c\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0db1\u0dd1. \u0daf\u0dc0\u0dc3\u0dd9 \u0d85\u0dc0\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0daf \u0db8\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf\u0dcf, \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dbd \u0dc4\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0db6\u0dd0\u0dab\u0db6\u0dd0\u0dab \u0d86\u0dba\u0dd9\u0dad\u0dca \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dd4\u0dc0 \u0db6\u0dbd\u0db4\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0db8 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0da2\u0dd2, \u0db4\u0db1\u0dd3\u0dbb\u0dca \u0db6\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dd2 \u0d91\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca \u0d95\u0da9\u0dbb\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dc5\u0dcf.\n",
