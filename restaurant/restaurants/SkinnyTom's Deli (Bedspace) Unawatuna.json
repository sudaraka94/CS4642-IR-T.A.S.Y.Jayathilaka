  "reviews": "Bedspace\u00a0is a reasonably new addition to Unwatuna. It\u2019s a hostel/BnB set up with a cafe that\u2019s just been renamed to Skinny Tom\u2019s Deli, though the old name has kind of stuck.\nTheir food\u2019s really good with service to match. The space and set up is extremely conducive for spending a couple of (or more) chilled out hours reading, writing, drawing, chatting or pretty much anything else you\u2019d do on holiday, even working like I was.\nTheir menu is big, but not overwhelmingly so. It\u2019s all drawn up with chalk on a wall, so it\u2019s real easy to look through. We went with a couple of breakfast classics, bridging the colonial with the local; the Eggs Benedict and Hoppers. We weren\u2019t disappointed.\nWe got the the Benedict with rye bread instead of the usual English muffin. It would have been better if it was served hotter. The kankun was a smart (if a little rubbery) touch.\nThe poached eggs were nice and runny and the salmon a tad on the saltier side than we\u2019d like but still good. By the way, all their bread is baked in-house.\nThe Pepper Beef Egg Hoppers were eggcellent. It was nice to see the kitchen not shying away from spicing the beef really well. The gravy is juicy and smooth. The beef was soft and had a nice stringy texture and placed on top of runny egg hoppers (just the right level of runny without having to ask! I love it when that happens).\nCombine it with a bit of dhal (which we asked for separately) and seeni sambol (which comes with the dish) and you have a smorgasbord of epic flavors that threaten to induce public moans of pleasure.\nTheir coffee is good and strong and (relatively) dirt cheap. The Double Latte and cappuccino both cost us just Rs. 300 each. The south coast really does have some great coffee spots. Maybe we\u2019ll make a list at some point.\nThey have smoothies and blends too. The Coconut Coriander (Rs 300) is a slightly spicy, vinegary dream. A real pick me up.\nThe brownie is not the best; though it looked like a million bucks, it tasted like two.\nIt was so sugary I\u00a0could feel the sugar\u00a0crunching in my mouth. The lemon peel and mint added a bit of variety to the flavor but ultimately the brownie was just a too-sweet mess\u00a0which felt like swallowing diabetes.\nThere is lots of open space, and room between seats, giving privacy, and nice comfortable chairs. There is great outdoor seating. But be warned, parking can be a pain.\nService was excellent. We went in April and there were free avurudu treats for guests laid out on a table.\nStaff are attentive, informed and thoroughly helpful.\nIf you\u2019re in Una, craving for some good food and chill vibes go check out Skinny Tom's Deli.\n",
