  "reviews": "Five months after it's opening, Let's Taco is still setting an example for good tex-mex in Sri Lanka. It certainly hits places like Taco Bell out of the cricket stadium, but for a slight\u00a0price premium. Be warned though, parking won't be the easiest to find here on busy days.\nWe started off with a small plate of Nachos (Rs. 900), the quantity of which was easily a full meal. The homemade nachos are mixed in with jalapenos,\u00a0onion, tomato, cheese dip and\u00a0avocado with a dose of lime providing seasoning.\nThe flavors mix in as you proceed to eat this messy dish, and by the end, what started off as something\u00a0bland is\u00a0a smorgasbord of creamy,\u00a0spicy sensations.\nMixing and matching flavors is also what you have to do when you prepare your tacos.\u00a0We picked the Siraccha Black Pepper Beef (Rs. 1,300). It came with guacamole and salsa sauce, as well as butter corn on the side. \u200b\nThe siraccha and pepper didn't compete for power, and the beef was in the end a democractic mix of tangy and peppery spices, a great overall combination that hit a six (yes, cricket metaphors are in for this post) when combined with the guacamole and salsa. Five stars.\nWe tried one of the homemade drinks, Zingy Orange (Rs.350), but it basically tasted like a variation of Orange Barley,\u00a0and\u00a0a little too sweet. The Mango Shake (Rs. 450) was a little steeply priced for its\u00a0quantity, but tasted better.\nThe service was exceptional.\u00a0Our waiter Nuwantha\u00a0knew the menu inside out and wasn't afraid to give recommendations, all of which (at least the ones we followed) delivered.\nFor desert we had their signature\u00a0Churro cup (Rs. 525). Note that there is nothing resembling a traditional churro here, only a cup made of the same stuff as a churro is.\u00a0Said cup is stuffed with ice cream, chocolate sauce and\u00a0other sweet things that were nicely\u00a0balanced out by the texture of the churro. We loved it.\nThis is where Let's Taco shines the most. The interior is spacious and gives plenty of privacy in\u00a0different rooms with subtly different atmospheres. Art is all over the place, and most of it is quite nice.\nWhile slightly on the pricier end, Let's Taco more than delivers on quality, ambiance and service.\nThe slightly high prices are worth it for the amazing tex-mex this place has to offer.\nA brand new Mexican fusion spot on Dickman's Road.\n\n\u0db1\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db8 \u0db8\u0dd9\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0db1\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dc3\u0da7 \u0da7\u0d9a\u0ddd \u0d9a\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0d95\u0db1 \u0db1\u0db8\u0dca \u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\n",
