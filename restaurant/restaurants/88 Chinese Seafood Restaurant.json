  "reviews": "88 Chinese Seafood Restaurant is a long time player in the local Chinese food scene. It's incredibly popular among b0th locals and Chinese expats, and while it wasn't terrible, it didn't really live up to the hype.\nSince the owners of 88 are Malaysian Chinese the food is not quite as authentic as the likes of\nor\n, but more so than local favourites like\nand\n. As is the case with all the veterans among Chinese eateries in Colombo, 88 has a vast menu along with some very reasonable prices. Small portions are priced between Rs. 450 - Rs. 650 and large portions cost about Rs. 200 - Rs. 300 more. Portions aren't huge but we'd say they were just right for two.\nThe hot garlic chicken (Rs. 588) was the pick of the dishes we tried, with a good balance of sweetness and spice. They stuck to the tried and tested preparation of lightly batter fried chicken in thick soy and oyster sauce with diced garlic. The soft chunks of boneless chicken and the somewhat heavy kick of the garlic is what really makes this one shine through.\nWe had high hopes for the hot butter cuttlefish (Rs. 628), but it ended up being quite underwhelming. The portion was also quite small compared to the other dishes. While the cuttlefish was cooked well, the pieces were very large and the batter was very thin, lacking seasoning and flavour.\nThe belly pork in shrimp sauce (RS. 618) was okay but it tasted quite one dimensional. The reason I call it one dimensional is because this one was well seasoned but didn't really have much spice or sweetness to enhance the flavour. But if you're looking for a salty pork dish, this one won't disappoint.\nThe interior of 88 has a striking resemblance to that of\n. In the same sense, this isn't really a place you go to for ambience but it seems like a good place for a casual family meet up. The only issue is that the tables are pretty close together so don't expect much privacy.\nThe service at 88 is like a well oiled machine. The food was ready in less than 7 minutes, which has to be some kind of a record, but it really does make you wonder how in the world it's possible. But with the crowds they get, I wouldn't be too surprised if they make some of the more popular dishes in bulk.\nIf you're looking for something new we wouldn't suggest 88, but if you're looking for a time tested restaurant, then you'll most likely leave satisfied.\n88 Chinese Seafood Restaurant is a long time player in the local Chinese food scene.
