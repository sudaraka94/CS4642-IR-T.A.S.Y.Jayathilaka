  "reviews": "Which Way West is a new entry into Colombo's pub scene. They're pretty well stocked when it comes to booze and their ladies night offers free cocktails. Food-wise they're alright, finally moving away from the Poppy Hana menu to realize their own. We dropped in for dinner.\nWhen I first checked out Which Way West, I was disappointed to see that it was still the same old Poppy Hana scene with a different name. This time, though, they've got it together and it's quite clear that it's a new menu. You can go for the peri peri chicken, steak, cuttlefish or a burger. We started off with their Hot Butter Cuttlefish (Rs 595).\nThey don't use any\u00a0batter here, so it's not crispy. I'm personally not a fan of this. The flavour is good, but if the crunch is what you're after, this is not for you.\nFor mains, we tried the\u00a0Classic Cheese Burger (Rs 645) which\u00a0came with a beef patty and french fries. This was pretty mediocre. The patty wasn't particularly juicy or flavourful, and there was nothing remarkable about the whole thing. At the price, it's not worth it.\n\nWe also tried the Rib Eye Steak (Rs 980). They didn't have imported beef, so we went with the local one, which is much cheaper. The cut is really thin, though, but they did heed our request for it to be prepared medium-rare which is rare. The beef was juicy and cooked just right, so no complaints there. Just wish it was a thicker cut to be considered a steak.\nFor dessert, we tried the\u00a0Oreo Ice Cream (Rs 425). This came topped with whipped cream and an Oreo. It's quite yum, actually, and as someone who doesn't enjoy ice cream too much, I quite liked it.\nService at Which Way West is pretty prompt. They will welcome you as you step in, which is always nice.\nYou have a few options when it comes to the actual setting. There's an outdoor area, if you want to indulge in some shisha. Then there's the pub area that's dimly lit, with a red glow. Then there's this cafe type scene which is better lit.\nWhich Way West is figuring out its own identity, after being weaned off its predecessor. They've got an Acoustic Night where you can win a free appetiser by performing a song with the house band. They've also got a crazy ladies night deal. We noticed a young and hip crowd in the outdoor section when we visited, so maybe this place will catch on. The food can improve, but there's plenty of booze to keep you busy, anyway.\nWhich Way West is a new entry into Colombo's pub scene. The food can improve, but there's plenty of booze to keep you busy, anyway.\nServing up sushi and shisha, Which Way West isn't quite as Western as we expected.\n",
