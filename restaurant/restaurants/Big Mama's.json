  "reviews": "Big Mama's is a home cook specializing in Dutch food, particularly lamprais. We're\n, so we were very intrigued to see where Big Mama's offering would stand amongst the stalwarts of\nand the like. You can get either pick up or delivery, as long as you order at least a day in advance.\nThey've also got Dutch sweets such as\u00a0bolofiado -\u00a0a layered pastry with fruit and nuts, fougeti -\u00a0a pastry tube filled with pumpkin preserve and nuts, and olliebollen -\u00a0a Dutch style donut with apple, cinnamon and raisins.\nFor this review, we stuck with the lamprais.\n\n\nOne thing we have to say from the get-go is that the\u00a0pricing and portions at Big Mama's are really good. You get a much, much larger portion than you would at\u00a0say, DBU, and at a similar price. So at Rs 500, it's fairly priced.\nNow, let's get down to the elements.\nFirst off, the rice. We found the rice to\u00a0be too salty, although quite flavourful. This was disappointing,\u00a0particularly when every other element involves a fair bit of salt, too.\nThe mixed meat came with a lot of pork, and not just fatty bits, but actual meat. It's super flavourful.\u00a0The belachan\u00a0was the best executed element of the lot, not too spicy, with the texture of pol sambol but the flavour of shrimp.\nBig Mama's does promise a Sri Lankan styling of Dutch food, so the seeni sambol was justified.\u00a0Then there was some brinjal and kehel muwa that was pretty good, too.\u00a0The frikkadel was well done, with the mutton minced so fine it almost had the texture of fish, though the little bit of gristle confirmed that it was indeed meat.\nHowever, all in all, when it all came together, we found it too overpowering simply because there was too much salt going on.\u00a0This can be easily remedied\u00a0though, so\u00a0maybe inform them about your palate's sensitivity and they can cater to it.\nIf you don't eat pork, there's an\u00a0option in which the mixed meat consists of beef, mutton and chicken. Aisha complained that she couldn't find any chicken. I can confirm that there was indeed chicken. The rice wasn't as salty on this one either.\nOverall, we liked this one much better than the other. It's a solid lamprais,\u00a0but it could be balanced out better.\nThe process of getting your lamprais is pretty simple and Big Mama herself is quite an endearing character over the phone. You can either arrange for pick-up from her home in Nawala, or you can arrange for delivery which they'll sort out via Hot Wheels. Keep in mind though that the delivery charge is Rs 300, so it makes more\u00a0sense if you're buying quite a few parcels. It was said to arrive at 12 noon and arrived at 12.30, so that's not too bad.\nWe're really happy to see another lamprais provider entering the game, and we're always happy to find new home cooks coming into the fray. We think the saltiness of the lamprais may have just been a one-off issue. Either way, we're sure they'll make it to your liking if you tell them.\n\n",
