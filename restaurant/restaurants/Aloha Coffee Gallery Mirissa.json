  "reviews": "Aloha Coffee Gallery is a small spot run out of a garage in Mirissa. They've got great food and coffee. The prices\u00a0compare pretty decently\u00a0to similar fare in other places.\nThey've got some pretty dope breakfast options, picked out of a nice and simple menu. Their smoothie bowls and\nsmoothie bowls are creative, and they've also got toast with various super/hipster foods like avocado and tofu. We tried a decent selection and came away happy.\nThe Peanut Butter Crunchy Bowl (Rs. 750) had a frozen peanut butter smoothie dolloped over coconut, oats, and bananas. Probably a damn good thing to eat if you're the healthy type who just got in from a morning of surfing.\u00a0It's good for hungover, tired types also. They seem to make\u00a0the smoothie the previous night\u00a0and freeze it, adding the other ingredients as they serve it to you in the morning.\nThe Avocado Toast comes in two versions. The No.1 (Rs. 750) has\u00a0crunchy sesame and pumpkin seeds with onion sprinkled\u00a0on top of the avocado. The mango chutney it comes with is a nice touch, adding a bit of sweet tanginess. The No.2 has beetroot and feta. Ask for a poached egg on top if you feel like it.\nThe seemingly unintentionally self-effacingly named\u00a0Hippie Toast (Rs. 600) has\u00a0scrambled tofu in a saliva inducing\u00a0coconut sauce. The sauce adds a\u00a0nice creamy element to the mushrooms and spinach.\nTheir coffee is really good. And very reasonably priced. We had a Latte (Rs. 400)\u00a0and Cappucino (Rs. 420)\u00a0that really hit the spot after a late night.\nYou'd be hard pressed to\u00a0get coffee this good\u00a0at these prices in CMB.\nOf course they also serve king coconut with metal straws.\nAloha is a foreign owned establishment and the staff are generally backpackers working on holiday. They're pretty friendly and know what is what, though they mistook our order and brought us Avocado Toast No.1 instead of No.2.\u00a0The place started some 2 years ago and is now the No.1 spot on Tripadvisor in Mirissa.\nThe space is nicely desiged with couches/mattresses, tables and chairs set under trees in the garden, as well as some indoor seating in the spacious interior.\nA good place for coffee and breakfast in Mirissa. Expect to spend just above Rs. 1000 per person for coffee and food.\n",
