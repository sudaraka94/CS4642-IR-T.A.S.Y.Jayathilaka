  "reviews": "Once known as Manning Mansions, the Hotel Nippon is now\u00a0a hotel with two restaurants and a cafe. We visited Bamboo Room after quite some time and had a very pleasant experience.\nTheir menu is pretty cut and dry with Sri Lankan and Asian cuisine. They even have a lunch buffet.\nWe started off with their Chicken Lamprais (Rs. 576). It was a delicious portion wrapped in a banana leaf. The strong cardamom and cloves aroma is enticing and ultimately satisfying. It is not a canonical\u00a0lamprais, however, it was one of the best we have tried. The rice is well cooked, the moju was succulent with a hint of sweetness when you bite in, the ash plantain was perfectly seasoned, the blachan was on point and it came with a\u00a0huge chicken leg that would fill you up on its own.\nWe also tried the Egg Fried Rice (Rs. 307). The seasoning of the rice was definitely more substantial than the ones you get at street joints. Here the rice is seasoned with natural spices and without too much oil. It was, however, a little too salty, but that didn't stop us from finishing it.\nWe also tried\u00a0the Sweet and Sour Prawns (Rs. 691).\u00a0The sauce was thick, and the sweetness infused with the tang from the pineapple made it delicious. The prawns were well cooked with a\u00a0crispy coating. We would have liked it better if the prawns and the sauce were mixed together.\nWe also tried the Vegetable Kuruma (Rs. 380) which was our least favorite. The whole dish tasted very bland. The coconut milk was very strong and the vegetables were overcooked and very mushy.\nFor dessert, we tried the Lava Cake with Ice Cream (Rs. 353). It didn't look as fancy as it did during our first look but it was still delicious. We prefered it to the Pizza Hut lava cake but it was a little dense. It was a big portion that could\u00a0certainly can be shared among two people.\nThe food got a bit late to arrive and we were really hungry, so that didn't help. The staff, however, was very friendly and accommodating, they even recommended some of the items.\nThe place is very spacious with velvet cushioned wooden chairs and tables. In terms of decor, it is pretty basic.\nAll in all, we enjoyed the place. It's a great place to drop by for lunch if you want to enjoy some Sri Lankan cuisine. Our total came up to about Rs. 3,000 which is pretty reasonable.\nA great place to drop by for lunch if you want to enjoy some Sri Lankan cuisine.\nThe Bamboo Room is a brand new restaurant that offers Kerala Cuisine. They're still getting on their feet but we dropped in anyways and had a pretty good experience overall.\n\n\u0db6\u0dd0\u0db8\u0dca\u0db6\u0dd6 \u0dbb\u0dd6\u0db8\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dd9\u0dc3\u0dca\u0da7\u0ddd\u0dbb\u0db1\u0dca\u0da7\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda \u0dc1\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd3 \u0dbd\u0d82\u0d9a\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc3\u0dc4 \u0d92\u0dc2\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0db8\u0dc0\u0dbd\u0da7\u0db8\u0dba\u0dd2.\n\n\u0db6\u0dd0\u0db8\u0dca\u0db6\u0dd6 \u0dbb\u0dd6\u0db8\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0d8b\u0db4\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0dc0\u0d9c\u0dda \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0db1\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db8 \u0dad\u0dbb\u0d9f\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dca \u0daf\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0db4\u0dd4\u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca. \u0da7\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db8\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca, \u0dad\u0dd4\u0db1\u0db4\u0dc4 \u0dc3\u0dd0\u0dbb \u0d85\u0da9\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0db6\u0dad\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca \u0d9a\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0d9a\u0dd0\u0db8\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0db1\u0d82, \u0db8\u0dd9\u0dad\u0db1 \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0db8 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca.\n",
