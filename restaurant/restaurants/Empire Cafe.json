  "description": "Empire Cafe is a little restaurant-cum-cafe housed inside the Olde Empire Hotel, a 200 year old building, right next to the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy. It's a popular tourist hangout, is surprisingly affordable, and has the best chocolate cake we've had in ages.",
  "reviews": "The caf\u00e9 is housed in the colonial, Olde Empire Hotel...that has been around since the 1890\u2019s. During its time the Olde Empire building has been used as a coffee factory (Kopi Kade)...frequented by lawyers and legal workers...In January 2014 Manor House Concepts took over the lower floor...and renovated it into the now vibrant Empire Caf\u00e9, one of the best restaurants in Kandy.\nThis is an excerpt from their website about the caf\u00e9's history. As it shows, the building has been around for about 200 years and the caf\u00e9 itself is a blend of the colonial and modern. I'm down for that!\nThe restaurant/caf\u00e9 is right next to the\nin Kandy. It is a popular tourist spot with affordable, delicious food.\nTheir menu mostly consisted of pasta, wraps, burgers and salad - quick and easy. The caf\u00e9 is located in an area where most people just want to pop in for a quick bite before continuing\u00a0their tour, so they cater to that.\nWe ordered a Kingdom Burger (Rs. 680) off their Empire Classic section which came with a side of chunky fries and ketchup. The potato patty was big and juicy, accompanied by\nof rocket lettuce leaves, eggplant, tomato, gherkin and a mustard tomato sauce. It was flavourful\u00a0and filling, definitely one of their popular\u00a0dishes.\u00a0The fries were crispy, salty and just yum!\nWe also got The Lankan Wrap (Rs. 615) which had a homemade parippu\u00a0vadai,\u00a0paneer, spicy caramelised\u00a0onions and mint filling with a side of chunky fries and ketchup. The combo worked surprisingly well. The tortilla wrap was thick and crunchy while the vadai and paneer spiced it up. There wasn't a lot\u00a0of caramelised\u00a0onions, but they had a generous amount of paneer so no complaints there.\nWe've said it before and we'll say it again, their desserts are heavenly! We got the Homemade Strawberry & Cinnamon ice cream and at Rs. 390, this is so worth it. It was absolutely delicious, and the\u00a0texture was creamy\u00a0with bits of strawberries to chew on. When you first taste it, you're immediately taken aback by the strong taste of cinnamon, but it recedes quickly and you find yourself going back for another bite, then another.\nHere's the thing. For their specials\u00a0that day, there was a\u00a0Pink Tea with Hibiscus and Jasmine\u00a0(Rs. 370). I ordered a pot because I have never tried Pink Tea. So either I'm colour blind or that is\npink tea. However, it did taste alright, and I definitely detected hibiscus and jasmine, but if you're gonna tell me I'm getting pink tea, I need pink tea.\nWe also got a Cappucino (Rs. 385) and it didn't taste as good as it looked. They told us there was something wrong with the machine which is probably true cause it tasted very bland and watery.\nThe interior design\u00a0of the place is beautiful with a pink and teal theme, big white cane chairs, Sri Lankan and Indian vintage posters and cute wall art.\u00a0The place still has remnants\u00a0of the elegant hotel it used to be, with its\u00a0old-fashioned reception, narrow corridors and\u00a0balcony.\nThe waitress who aided to our needs was very friendly and bubbly, giving us our time and space to order. The rest of the staff was friendly and hospitable too.\nTheir mains have improved a lot since we last visited. You get the feeling of being inside an old Kandyan caf\u00e9 chomping on delicious food while staring out the window. The place is timeless. If you're ever in Kandy, drop by for a visit.\nIt is a popular tourist spot with affordable, delicious food.\nEmpire Cafe is a little restaurant-cum-cafe housed inside the Olde Empire Hotel, a 200 year old building, right next to the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy.
