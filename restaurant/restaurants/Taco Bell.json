  "reviews": "Taco Bell is\ncrowded, several months after it opened. We walked in during lunch hour on a weekday and there were office workers, students, parents with their kids, tourists. In short,\u00a0a wide demographic slice of the city was in representation. Field researchers take note, this might be\u00a0a great place to carry out that next survey.\nOne weird thing they do when you order, the first thing they ask for is your phone number. I'm like, excuse me, why do you need my phone number? And the guy behind the counter said they wanted to send me news about their promotions. I politely declined. But I'm guessing lots of people simply think that this is somehow a pre-requisite to place your order. PSA: Don't just give out your phone number to random people guys, especially corporations.\nLook, let's face it,\u00a0Taco Bell is\u00a0fast food. You're not going here looking for something healthy. Things here\u00a0have\u00a0a preserved sort of feel that reminds me vaguely of scenes from\n. If you want Mexican food that's closer to fresh and healthy, check out a place like\nor\n.\nThe Quesadilla (Rs. 530) was decent, there was lots of stringy, pully cheese and the Fajita Chicken had a flavor\u00a0vaguely reminiscent of curry. The Crispy Fish Taco (Rs.330) was quite good, the fish was crunchy and had a tang that reminded me of dried\u00a0fish or\n. This is a good thing. I like\n. A lot. The cheese sauce on it was pretty good too.\nWe tried the Cheesy Nachos (Rs. 360) and liked them. The cheese was flavorful and the onions and tomatoes made a nice tangy addition. But the toppings were dismally insufficient for the amount of nachos on the plate, leaving us to use them to scoop up drippings from the other food we ate (not as satisfying).\nThe Mexical Chicken\u00a0Chalupa (Rs. 390) would be best described with a meh (that's a verbal shrug for you language prudes).\u00a0The dough was too fluffy. The salad took up too much space. Everything tasted like flour.\nThe Cheesy\u00a0Double Decker Taco (Rs.530) received applause for its smart construction. Here was a crispy taco covered in a tortilla, so it wouldn't break apart and spill its contents all over the place.\nThe Chocodilla (Rs.200)\u00a0tastes basically like a chocolate rotti, you must have had them at Pillawoos or down South at some point. It's also rather sugary, and you're not going to be able to eat the whole thing unless you have a strong taste for sugary, cheap\u00a0chocolate, and complete lack of fear of getting diabetes, putting on weight, getting pimples, losing all your friends etc. JK. Your\u00a0friends will still like you (hopefully).\nThe Irish Coffee Ice Cream Shake (Rs. 350) was syrupy sweet, not my thing but maybe you'd like it. The Lemon Mojito (Rs. 250) was a little too strong, and tasted as if\u00a0whatever they put in there to mimic the lemon (Sprite?) was overdosed, or maybe it just had too much mint. Anyway, the drinks weren't anything to get too excited about.\nThe service is smiley and welcoming. There is a clearly evident, thick facade of very strong training. Interestingly, we didn't spot any women on the staff the time we were there. No idea if this is normal for Taco Bell Colombo. Let us know what you think.\nTaco Bell has a big and spacious interior with enough room for privacy around a table with a few friends. Bigger tables will accomodate larger groups, and families welcome. The color scheme is nice and warm. There's graffiti and street art giving a bit of an edgy feel.\u00a0But not too edgy, this is after all a mass market enterprise.\nThe food here is really nothing to write in your diary about, much of it is mediocre, with a few moments of slightly-better-than-mediocre.\u00a0Most of it seems to be made on the premise that if you smother something in cheese, people will eat it.\nIt's got room to hang out in, is easily accessed and has\u00a0lots of parking, so it's got all these things going for it.\u00a0 But in the end it's a fast food chain, and just like you wouldn't go to KFC for the 'best fried chicken', you wouldn't be going to Taco Bell for the 'best Tex-Mex'.\u00a0Fortunately for you, Colombo now\u00a0has better options.\nThe Tex-Mex here is still mediocre, but Taco Bell is inexplicably still crowded months after its opening.\nThe international fast food bigwig Taco Bell has landed right in the middle of Colombo!\n\n\u0dc3\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dd9 \u0db4\u0ddd\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0db8\u0dca \u0d85\u0da9\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dbd\u0dca \u0db6\u0dbd\u0d82 \u0d89\u0db3\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0d85\u0db4\u0dd2 \u0db6\u0dd0\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0db8 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1 \u0dc3\u0dd9\u0db1\u0d9c \u0d85\u0da9\u0dd4 \u0d87\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dbd \u0dc4\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db6\u0dbd\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0d9c\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf \u0dc4\u0ddd\u0da7\u0db1\u0dca \u0db4\u0dca\u0dbd\u0dda\u0dc3\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a \u0db4\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad\u0dd9.\n",
