  "reviews": "Where can you be sure to find pork curry for lunch? A good Sinhalese rice-and-curry\n, of course. That is exactly what Nelum Kole does. If you live or work around Maharagama/Boralesgamuwa, this spot off Lake Road is one you need\u00a0to try out. It ought to go without saying, but I\u2019ll reiterate,\u00a0their food is not halal, and they do not serve beef.\nIdeal for takeaway, Nelum Kole serves up pork, chicken and fish options, along with an array of greens and vegetables. For a little over Rs. 200,\u00a0you can grab a full or half plate of\u00a0red or white rice, with a meat of your choice, and choose what else goes on your plate as the server runs through the options with you.\nThey\u2019re really busy during lunchtime, so be prepared to stand in line. If you\u2019re eating in, the food is served on a lotus leaf (hence the name), and offered to you in a woven basket. As you pay for your meal, notice that the cashier will touch the inside of his right elbow with his left hand. This is a gesture that is best returned as you hand over the cash.\nI had the pork curry with red rice,\n, manioc curry,\nand beans. I was then asked if I would like any additional meat that included\u00a0two types of fried fish, fried chicken neck and batter-fried prawns. I was curious to try the prawns, so I did, at an additional\u00a0cost of Rs. 240.\nThe food here is salty by my standards, so if you're\u00a0watching your blood pressure, drink plenty of water. The\nwas neither hard nor too mushy, and a lively shade of yellow. The manioc curry was my favourite as the salt hadn\u2019t saturated it, so it helped balance out the rest of the meal. The beans were nothing to write home about \u2014\u00a0they were green, they were curried, and they were beans. And I didn\u2019t get my money\u2019s worth on the prawns. Although they weren't aggressively seasoned, they had been chilling outside on the\u00a0display for a while and had lost their crispness. If you\u2019re going to go for any of the fried options, go early! Like at 12 noon.\nNow that we\u2019ve got all that out of the way, let\u2019s talk about the pork. You have the options of grilled pork, curry pork and devilled pork to go with your rice. The curry pork I had was a generous portion, but\u00a0when closely analysed, it turned out to be 60% fat and 40% meat. The meat itself was flavourful, but by no means could you call it a good cut. If you\u2019re into the juicy, fatty bits, then you\u2019re going to love it. Next time, I\u2019ll be trying the\u00a0grilled pork.\nWhen you\u2019re done eating, you can leave your lotus leaf and basket on the table, wash your hands and head out, while the\u00a0servers swiftly ready the tables for the next lot of customers.\nThis is where Nelum Kole really scores. Though it looks rather unassuming from the outside, you notice the rustic decor and thatched roof\u00a0the moment you step in.\u00a0It has the authentic Sinhalese\nfeels, and warm yellow lighting that really brings out the earthy walls.\nThe tables and chairs are the furthest thing from fancy, and that\u2019s part of the charm. It\u2019s rustic. It\u2019s warm. It\u2019s welcoming. And, if you ask nicely, you can join a table where there are already others sitting down to a meal.\nNelum Kole is not necessarily a place you\u2019d take your better half to on a date. But it\u2019s a convenient and cost-effective option for lunch if you work or happen to be driving through the area.\nTheir regulars claim it is the best option in the vicinity and find no fault in the food. I think it\u2019s too salty, and I would have liked more meat in my pork curry. The positives?\u00a0They do a great job of dealing with a high volume of take-away orders, and I didn\u2019t find myself wasting time standing in line. Besides, two people can eat here for Rs. 500. Need I say more?\n\n",
