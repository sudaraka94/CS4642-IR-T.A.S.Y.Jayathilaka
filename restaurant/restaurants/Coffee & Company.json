  "reviews": "Coffee & Company, as its names\u00a0implies, is a coffee shop. Located\u00a0in a gorgeous colonial mansion at the end of a quiet lane down Pedris Mawatha, it brews coffee in a myriad of ways: black, short, long, iced, with milk, flavoured, etc. And the place also makes the regulars,\u00a0from breakfast items to pastas or burgers and desserts.\nLast time we dropped by was more than a year ago, not long after their opening, so we decided it was time to pay them another visit.\nCoffee & Company's main focus being coffee, I'll start with the brew. For this second visit, we tried the Cappuccino (Rs. 380), which was rather satisfactory. The foam was the only miss of the drink really. It was super bubbly and so light it was like sipping air. Plus, with this texture, no latte art could possibly happen. Some cocoa powder sprinkled on top would have done the trick in terms of presentation though. Anyway, apart from the foam and look, the actual taste of the drink was good, the coffee was mild and not bitter at all. Not unpleasant to slowly wake up or to peacefully go through the day.\nWe came for breakfast and, really, what's better than to start the day with some Avocado on Toast (Rs. 850)?\u00a0The smashed avocado was nicely seasoned with a hint of lime that refreshed the rich puree and bits of chili flakes that just brought some colour\u00a0to the dish. The poached egg was not as brilliant, as it was\u00a0slightly undercooked. The egg yolk was runny but the white as well, which isn't as enjoyable. Bread was good but wasn't very different from the\nbread you can find at your usual supermarket.\u00a0Also, it was supposed to come\u00a0with feta and roasted tomatoes but to my great disappointment, we\u00a0couldn't trace any Greek cheese and there only were 2 measly slices of fresh tomatoes on the plate.\nWe also got a Cookie for about Rs. 120 and it clearly was a bad choice. The biscuit had\u00a0probably been made the week before and was as hard as a rock. Or almost. It was OK-ish after dipping it in the cap for\u00a0a good 30 seconds. But still the taste was not mind blowing.\nService is\u00a0efficient and the staff\u00a0friendly.\u00a0The coffee and cookie came straight away and we didn't have to wait for long for the avocado toasts either.\nThe ambience is really what we'll make us come back to Coffee & Company. The interior decoration matches the charm of the outside. Everything there\u00a0is leather, wood and\u00a0cane and the dominant colours are warm varieties of brown,\u00a0beige and yellow and some notes of black and grey.\u00a0The jazzy music in the background adds to the elegance of the place.\nYou can choose to sit on comfy Parisian bistro looking chairs, to curl up on one the 2 imposing armchairs or to crash on the inviting sofa. You can also decide to make the best\u00a0of their big garden and terrace outside.\nCoffee & Company struck\u00a0me as a great place for a date, as it's kind of romantic and really quiet and tranquil. It can also be a good hideout to gather your friends or relatives and while away the heat or the hours on a lazy afternoon. And it\u00a0definitely makes an awesome book nook to add on to our\n.\nCoffee & Company is an ideal spot to wind up with your loved one(s), may they be your lover, friends or\u00a0books. Order a drink (and food if you're really starving) and enjoy the quietness.\nStylish and quiet caf\u00e9 located in a lane down Pedris Mawatha.\nLocated down a quiet lane on 30th Lane via Pedris Mawatha, Coffee & Co is the newest addition  to Colombo's multitude of coffeeshops.\n\n\u0d94\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dad\u0dca \u0dc4\u0dc0\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0d9a \u0d9c\u0dd9\u0daf\u0dbb \u0dba\u0db1 \u0d9c\u0db8\u0db1\u0dca \u0db4\u0ddc\u0da9\u0dca\u0da9\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db8\u0dda\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0d9c\u0ddc\u0da9 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0db6\u0dbd\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0d9a\u0ddd. \u0db8\u0dc4\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dba \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0dc4\u0dda \u0d9c\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf \u0daf \u0db1\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0dc0\u0dda\u0dc0\u0dd2.\n",
