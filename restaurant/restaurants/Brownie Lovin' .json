  "description": "Brownie Lovin' is one of Colombo's awesome brownie bakers. The brownies are extremely gooey and chocolatey, and affordable. ",
  "reviews": "Brownie Lovin' is a great home baker that specializes in baking brownies. We just tried two of their concoctions and we absolutely loved them, probably the gooeyest brownies we've had in a long time.\nThey do a handful of special recipes that seem to work well, using favourites like strawberries, coconut, cookies and M&Ms. It's all priced at around Rs. 700, for six pieces in a box. We got this menu off\nwhere you can stay tuned for menu updates. We got their classic and popular 'Talk Dirty To Me', an extra gooey chocolatey brownie, and the 'Funfetti' which incorporates M&Ms and sprinkles (Rs. 750 each).\nThis is a home-baker so unfortunately they don't deliver. You have to order a day in advance and go to Wellawatte to pick your order up.\nBesides Brownie Lovin' the only brownies I really love are at\nand\n(both make ready-to-go brownies), but\nis also known for their killer brownies. Let us know if you've had amazing brownies elsewhere.\nOur brownies came surprisingly very warm (the best way to have your brownies). The Talk Dirty To Me brownies are a gooey mess, in the best way, with a creamy thick, sweet chocolatey layer on top, and a squishy moist cakey center, and everything is thoroughly drenched in chocolate. It's one of those things you wake up from hours later, after passing out from a sugar coma.\nThe Funfetti is a lot of fun to eat, and ideal if you've got a kid you want to surprise with brownies. Again, sweet, gooey soft brownies, covered in colourful sprinkles and M&Ms. This is much sweeter than the ordinary brownies for obvious reasons.\nBrownie Lovin' is a legit choice if you're looking for excellent, soft brownies slathered in obscene amounts of chocolate. Considering quality and quantity, their prices are good too.\n",
