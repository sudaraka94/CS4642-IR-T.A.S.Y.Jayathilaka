  "reviews": "The Galle Fort's a rather expensive place, with next to no budget friendly options except for the petti-kadeys. A couple of broke friends and I were lurking around looking for aforementioned petti kadeys or reasonable\u00a0looking places to dig into something, when we stumbled upon the YMBA which houses a rotti kadey and a few fabric stores. The prices were displayed outside, and as soon as we saw that there was fancy rotti for around Rs 300, we popped right in.\nThe menu mostly consisted of rottis, pancakes, and drinks. We took one of each.\nWe picked the Chocolate Rotti (Rs. 350), and I was expecting a regular rotti sized sandwich. What we got was a wrap, which\u00a0while not bad, was a bit smaller than expected (but then again, my bad, because it\nFort, after all). The rotti was a bit crunchy, and a bit dry - much\u00a0like the frozen rottis or wraps that you find at\u00a0supermarkets.\u00a0My friend\u00a0insisted this was the case\u00a0and that she's had the same rotti for dinner at home \u2014 so maybe that explains the pita-ish texture.\nInterestingly, Nutella hadn't been used.\u00a0The unmistakable taste of Kandos seeped through, and that was pretty cool because\u00a0I don't often experience\u00a0Kandos chocolate with food.\nThe Banana Pancake, (priced the same), was rather a disappointment because it wasn't a pancake. As in, it was another rotti, wrapped around bananas.\nNothing much to say about it, except that as far as rottis and bananas go, this passes. Both dishes were drizzled with\n, which\u00a0added a nice, sweet touch.\u00a0Both of these come\u00a0with straighforward coffee/tea.\nTheir Pineapple Lassi (Rs. 250), though a bit watery, was refreshing and well made, with the pineapple and curd smoothly blended in. It was a tad too liquid\u00a0for a lassi, but given that pineapples are quite watery, I assume this is because of the fruit involved.\nIt's also quite a generous portion, unlike the rottis and pancakes, so there's value for money with the drink.\nThis is a rather cozy and compact space, with high tables and stools, and good 90's music. Service is pleasant and friendly, nothing to complain about.\nThere are some nice wall hangings, and a cool flourescent blackboard displaying the specials.\u00a0It's a bit run down (the YMBA building itself), but that just adds to the vibe.\nWe're looking to do a low-budget round-up on Galle soon, but until then, this place isn't bad. The food isn't outstanding, but for the location and the meal, it's kind of solid. Also, the people are nice and the atmosphere is chilled out. It gets a bit warm (no air-con), but there's a fan. And they have Wi Fi.\n",
