  "reviews": "Romano serves authentic wood-fired\u00a0Italian\u00a0pizzas along with other dishes like spaghetti, ravioli and risotto about 350m from the Pita Kotte junction. We dropped in for an early dinner and had a surprisingly\u00a0good experience.\nTheir pizza menu has a wide range of toppings, including more than one vegetarian option. The pizzas itself are relatively large and as far as texture and flavour go, it tastes pretty authentic.\nSince we had the option, we went for two half-and-half pizzas. First one was the Pizza Quattro Formaggio and Pizza Romano (Rs. 1400). They charge for the more expensive of the two choices. The four-cheese pizza was mouthwateringly delicious, with your normal 4 types of cheese of blue cheese, ricotta, parmesan and mozzarella. There was enough melted cheese to fill you up after about 2 slices with a succulent crispy thin crust. It wasn't as good as our favourite at\nbut it was a close second.\nThe other half was filled with BBQ chicken, tomato, roasted capsicum, spinach, anchovy, coriander leaves, pineapple and mozzarella. While they could have been more generous with the toppings, it was still\u00a0delicious but not as filling as you would have liked.\nWe also got another half-and-half which was the Bismarck and Ortolana (Rs. 1500). On the meat side of things, the Bismarck was our favourite with generously topped\u00a0well-cooked bacon, roasted vegetables, tomato, mushroom, mozzarella with an egg sunny-side up. The saltiness of the bacon and the fresh veggies were a great combo. Everything contributed to a rich, filling 4 slices.\nThe other half was vegetarian with roasted bell pepper, zucchini, aubergine, onion, black olives, artichoke, tomato and fresh mozzarella. It wasn't as flavourful as the Four Cheese but it was still a decent pizza.\nSince they were out of desserts we opted for one of their specials, which was the Spaghetti Bolognese (Rs. 14oo). We asked that for takeaway to see their packaging since they do home delivery and it was nothing special, just your normal aluminium foil takeaway box. It was also way too pricey for a spaghetti, and you're much better off opting for the pizza instead. Taste-wise it was alright, the spaghetti was cooked well and the Bolognese sauce was lightly spicy, but still not worth Rs.1400.\nThe service was really great. There were a couple of waiters who were really helpful and ready to answer any questions we had. It took about 20 minutes for our food to arrive which is a bit longer than I would have liked.\nIt's a small restaurant wedged in between equally\u00a0small shops. However, they have pretty much made complete use of their space. The interior gives you your normal low-budget Italian Pizzeria\u00a0vibe with wooden furniture and Roman-themed wall art. They also have outdoor seating as well. The kitchen is open with a huge wood-fired oven.\nThere's also a private room inside, where you can have private gatherings and the room is completely free, accommodating about 10-15 people.\nIt was a good experience with delicious pizzas. We would not recommend the pasta at that price point, but the pizzas are a great choice. Drop in for some dinner and let us know what you think.\nAuthentic wood-fired\u00a0Italian\u00a0pizza.\n\n\u0d85\u0db4\u0da7 \u0daf\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9c\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0dbd\u0dd0\u0db6\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0da7 \u0db8\u0dda \u0d85\u0dc0\u0da7 \u0d89\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0d9c\u0ddc\u0da9\u0d9a\u0dca \u0daf\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dcf \u0db8\u0dd9\u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd3\u0dc3\u0dcf \u0d85\u0dbb\u0d9c\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0dba\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dbd\u0dd4.\n",
