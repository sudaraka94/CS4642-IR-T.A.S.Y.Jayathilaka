  "reviews": "The Mango Tree down Dharmapala Road boasts of authentic North Indian cuisine. For the most part, it doesn't disappoint.\u00a0YAMU\nthis place in early 2013, and it didn't win too many accolades back then, mostly due to crappy service. We figured that a place could change a lot\u00a0in two years, and decided it was time to check it out again\u00a0\u2014 and we were happily not let down.\nWe walked in for lunch, and it was more than half-packed even though it was a weekday. As luck would have it, there were about two tables free, and we were ushered towards them as\u00a0soon as we walked in. We were then presented with the menu and a basket of complimentary\n.\n.\nThe stewards were efficient and service was quite fast. We received our orders within 15\u00a0minutes. A single portion at Mango Tree\u00a0is more than sufficient\u00a0for two people (including the soups).\u00a0We started off with the soup, a chicken shorba (Rs. 450).\nWe really liked the chicken shorba because of how flavoursome it was. The consistency was thick and somewhat creamy, while also being subtly spicy at the same time. The heat hits\u00a0you really slowly, so your mouth kind of waters for\u00a0a few minutes after you've\u00a0finished slurping it up.\nAccording to the description on the menu, the dum aloo punjabi (Rs. 795) had\u00a0whole potatoes stuffed with onions, cottage cheese\u00a0and vegetables, and cooked in an onion gravy. This dish was heavy and sweet, and 'onion gravy' isn't really as weird as it sounds. The onions didn't have that overpowering smell or taste.\u00a0We had this both with the\n(Rs. 250)\u00a0and with the steamed Basmati rice (Rs. 425), and it paired really well with both.\u00a0As you can see in the photo below, the potatoes were drowned in the oniony paste. This is definitely one of the better vegetarian dishes I've tasted for the sheer amount of flavour in it, and I'd recommend it even though it's on the pricey end of the spectrum.\nThe chicken tikka masala (Rs. 975) was also delicious, but I think it was a bit too expensive for the amount of meat in it. If I recall correctly, there were only about five\u00a0little pieces of chicken, and we would have liked more\u00a0(especially since that dish alone came up to nearly a thousand\u00a0bucks). Although it looked red and hot, this dish wasn't spicy.\u00a0We liked it, but I personally didn't think it's worth it. Notwithstanding the meat, though, the\u00a0gravy was a generous portion that\u00a0could probably have served about four people.\nWe don't have pictures of the drinks, a fresh papaya juice (Rs. 450) and masala tea (Rs. 295), but both of them fared well.\u00a0The papaya juice tasted fresh and\u00a0wasn't too watery\u00a0or too thick.\u00a0It practically tasted like a papaw itself. I loved the masala chai though, and it was definitely worth the price given that there were more than two teacups full of tea in the pot.\nService was pretty fast and the stewards were good. Some of them seem rather young and new, and\u00a0lacking a bit of confidence, but they did their job efficiently, serving the food the first time around and clearing the plates as soon as we were done.\u00a0(In one humorous instance, the steward spooned rice on to my plate and then walked off, making my friend wonder about gender equality).\u00a0The ambience is one of an upscale restaurant. The seating arrangements are a bit too crowded-in for my liking, and they could be spaced out a bit better, but overall it's a pretty nice place. It's an\u00a0expensive restaurant, frequented by many foreigners.\nThe Mango Tree whips up some pretty nice dishes, especially of the vegetarian kind. The flavours feel (and most probably are) authentic, with an underpinning\u00a0of cinnamon, garlic, cloves, cardamom\u00a0and other spices, as opposed to the flat and generic taste you get in\u00a0most other places. They also serve really nice masala tea. The prices are somewhat expensive though, and don't include taxes and the service charge.\n\n\nThe Mango Tree is one of the better (and more popular) Indian joints out there, specialising in North Indian cuisine. Although the prices are definitely upscale, the authentic flavours and attentive service justify the premium.\nMango Tree is a hugely popular Indian restaurant on Dharmapala Mawatha serving mainly North Indian cuisine. The food is very rich, but it can be good. Order wisely.\n\n\u0db8\u0dd0\u0d82\u0d9c\u0ddd \u0da7\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd3 \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda \u0d89\u0dad\u0dcf \u0da2\u0db1\u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dba \u0d89\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca \u0d85\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc4\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dca. \u0d86\u0dc4\u0dcf\u0dbb \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3\u0dba\u0dd2. \u0dc4\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dcf \u0db6\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0d87\u0dab\u0dc0\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1.\n",
