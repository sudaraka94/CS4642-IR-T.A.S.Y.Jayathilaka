  "reviews": "Greenlands is a South Indian vegetarian restaurant that has been around as long as I can remember.\u00a0I even recall\u00a0fond tales from my parents who would rendezvous\u00a0there in their youth. Its strongest point is the nostalgia, to be honest, and anyone who's been there over the years will attest to that. There's way more competition\u00a0these days, and they don't seem the overly competitive type.\nBuddhika decided to try their rice and curry for lunch. I went with the paper dosai, though their onion dosai is also good.\nThe rice and curry (Rs 200) is\u00a0quite wholesome, with plenty of dhal, a little bit of mango pickle. The main curry is bittergourd, which added a sharp acidic kick. You don't get your usual spicy flavours of a Sri Lankan rice and curry, so this might not be for everyone. I particularly love the contrast of texture when you mix the papadam with the wet rice and curry.\nMy paper dosai\u00a0(Rs 185) wasn't served in any dramatic fashion, just a long roll.\u00a0It wasn't too oily and just perfectly crisp. I have no complaints, really.\u00a0It filled me up and the price was\u00a0reasonable.\nI like to have thayir vadai/curd vadai\u00a0(Rs 90) as a sort of dessert. We\u00a0quite liked the flavourful curd that it sat in, as we tried to make out what went into it. There's some caramelized onions in there that add some depth to the flavour.\nWe washed it all down with some buttermilk (Rs 110). It was pretty good.\u00a0The green chili and onions are what really add to the character of an otherwise plain concoction. It's fairly rich, though it isn't super thick, and I wouldn't be able to finish one by myself.\nThe staff at Greenlands seem as old as the establishment itself, sporting hair as white as their crisp white dhoti and shirt. When the place is not too busy, they are fairly amicable. Ordering is pretty straightforward.\u00a0If you don't know what you want, you can ask them, though there's a large board with the whole menu at the entrance for that purpose. Sometimes\u00a0when the place is busy\u00a0they can seem a little grouchy (in\u00a0particular\u00a0one of the older, short men who always seems to ignore me when I try to speak in Tamil). There's no service charge, so\u00a0don't forget to tip them!\nThis is what I love most about Greenlands. Though the interior is painted a muted, almost sickly green, the large paintings on the wall are just fabulous. You're immediately transported to a world of kitsch South Indian imagery, with Krishna on one side, and a court dancer right in front of you. The place is quite clean, though if it were lit brighter it would seem more so.\nWhile there are many other South Indian restaurants serving much better fare, Greenlands still holds a place in people's heart for sheer nostalgia. They do what they do quite well. However, in comparison, it's not really\u00a0better than places like Shanmugas\u00a0or Thalis. Prices are reasonable, so two can eat for under Rs 1000 easily. Oh, and they have the rare combo of a liquor bar and a/c hotel rooms also on offer, so that's something!\n\nGreenlands still holds a place in people's heart for sheer nostalgia.\nGreenlands is great, and a long-running institution from what I gather. It\u2019s a budget South-Indian joint in a peaceful location, that has oodles of run-down character and is as cheap as anything.\n\n\u0daf\u0dc0\u0dbd\u0dca \u0daf\u0dd9\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dbb \u0d94\u0dc6\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0d91\u0dc5\u0dd2\u0dba\u0da7 \u0db6\u0dd0\u0dc4\u0dd0\u0db4\u0dd4 \u0d85\u0db4\u0dd2 \u0daf\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dcf \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc1\u0dcf\u0d9a\u0dcf \u0db4\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9c\u0dd2\u0dc4\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9c\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd4 \u0db4\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dad\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd0\u0db1\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0dc2\u0dd8\u0db6\u0dd9\u0dbb\u0dd2 \u0d8b\u0daf\u0dca\u200d\u0dba\u0dcf\u0db1 \u0db4\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0da7 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf. \u0d94\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0d91\u0dad\u0d9a\u0ddc\u0da7 \u0dad\u0db8\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0dba\u0db1 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dad\u0dbb\u0dda \u0d89\u0db8\u0dcf\u0da9\u0dca \u0db8\u0da7 \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dd9.\n\n\u0d9c\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd3\u0db1\u0dca\u0dbd\u0db1\u0dca\u0da9\u0dca \u0dc4\u0ddd\u0da7\u0dbd\u0dba \u0d85\u0da9\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0dd2\u0dc5\u0da7 \u0daf\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4 \u0d89\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca \u0d86\u0dc4\u0dcf\u0dbb \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0db1\u0db8\u0db1 \u0db4\u0dd0\u0dbb\u0dab\u0dd2 \u0db4\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dd4\u0db8 \u0d87\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0d91\u0dc4\u0dd9\u0dad\u0dca \u0dc3\u0dcf\u0db8\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dd3 \u0dc0\u0da7\u0db4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0d9a \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dc4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dd2 \u0d85\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc4\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dca.\n",
