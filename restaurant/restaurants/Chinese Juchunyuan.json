  "reviews": "Chinese Juchunyuan in Colpetty is one of the few places in town to try out\nChinese hotpot. The catch, however, is that if you don't add the right\ningredients, you'll basically end up drinking broth. On the flipside, it can\nalso be excellent should you make it right.\nWhen we first tried out the hotpot at Juchunyuan about a year back, we\nkinda' hated it, but that was partly due to our inexperience when it came to\nhotpots. The food here is definitely an acquired taste and any local planning\non dining here should be willing to try something very much different from the\nfood we generally get at other Chinese eateries. They do offer fried rice and\nside dishes but everyone seems to come here for the hotpot. Prices are quite\naffordable with the hotpot easily enough for four people.\nThey have a whole bunch of different options when it comes to choosing your\nsoup, which can be a bit confusing for those (like me) who aren't very familiar\nwith the procedure. After some deliberation, we decided to go with the half\nchicken soup (Rs. 600) with fish balls (Rs. 366). In retrospect, we should\nprobably have gone for a different soup since the boiled chicken in the one we\ngot, was all but tasteless.\nOne thing to note though, is the fact that\nthese fish balls were not actually balls of fish meat, rather something they\nimport which has an interestingly fishy flavour and an almost gelatinous\ntexture.\nAlong with the soup they bring you a few\ningredients - chopped cilantro, chili tofu, chili paste, soy sauce, chopped\ngarlic and an interesting peanut sauce. This is actually where all the flavour\nof your hotpot comes from. The waiter will make a sort of paste using all the\ningredients, but then he'll bounce and leave you\nguessing.\nAfter playing around a bit we found that\nadding said paste to the hotpot really makes a world of difference when it\ncomes to the flavour. We did so judiciously since we didn't want the flavours\nto be overpowering. Once we hit a good balance, we were left with quite a tasty\nsoup with a bit of heat from the chillies, cilantro aroma and saltiness from\nthe soy sauce. We added the paste to the steamed rice, and even that tasted\ngood.\nJust to cover all the bases, we went ahead\nand got the pork and mushroom casserole (Rs. 646) which tasted pretty\ngood with a slightly thick gravy and very flavoursome black mushrooms,\nalthough it could have had less veges and more pork.\nJuchunyuan is pretty much the definition of ghetto Chinese. The ground floor\ndining room bares a striking resemblance to a washroom, complete with bathroom\ntiles. What's great though is that everyone that dines here seems to embrace\nthe ambience. So yeah, this certainly would not qualify as fancy. They've also\ngot a tiny ancient TV in there as well, playing black and white Sinhalese\nfilms, which creates a very apparent mismatch between the clientele and\nentertainment.\nThey've got one local waiter, who was friendly though with a very limited\nattention span. Besides that the food was prepared quite fast, so we didn't\nfind ourselves getting angsty.\nChinese Juchunyuan is not for everyone, and there's a good chance that their\nhotpot may not appease local palates. However, if you're really looking to try\nsomething new, this may be just the place you're looking for.\nChinese Juchunyuan in Colpetty is one of the few places in town to try out Chinese hotpot. The catch, however, is that if you don't add the right ingredients to the hotpot you'll basically end up drinking broth. On the flipside, it can also be excellent should you make it right.\nChinese Juchunyuan is a little petti kade semi-authentic restaurant in a corner of Duplication Road that serves hot pot Chinese. The place isn't much for ambience, the food isn't for everybody, but at least it's an accessible place if you want to cook your own Chinese.\n",
