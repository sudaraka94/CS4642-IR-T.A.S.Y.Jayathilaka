  "reviews": "Zephyr is the latest beach brand to expand to Arugam Bay, in their case from\n. Despite having to enter through the back of Siam View, they have a nice location and quite good food and drink.\nZephyr is literally in the Siam View garden. Unfortunately you have to enter through basically the loading bay of Siam View and when we went it smelled a bit. Once you get past that it's nice.\nOnce you get in there's a nice view of the beach and seating, though note that it gets well hot during the day. The shadiest spot is at the bar.\nThey also do some pretty tasty cocktails, in this case a mango mojito. This was tasty with a good amount of fresh mango and mint in there. Zephyr can get pretty bumping at night and sometimes has live music, so it's not a bad place to check out in the evening.\n",
