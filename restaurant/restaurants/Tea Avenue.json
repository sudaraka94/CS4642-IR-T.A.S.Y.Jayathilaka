  "reviews": "Perched right on the busy junction of Barnes Place and Wijerama Mawatha, Tea Avenue is a fairly large (and busy) coffee shop.\nAt a whopping Rs. 890, Tea Avenue's decadent Ferrero Lavish is the stuff of Instagasms. They use quality ingredients, like entire blobs of chocolate ice cream, Anchor milk, chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and of course Ferrero Rocher, to create the perfect dessert (unless you're diabetic or watching your weight or something). Fair warning, this is really hard to get through on your own unless you're a complete beast. I'd suggest getting two straws and sharing it with someone cute like in an\n.\nWe asked for recommendations on their tea, but didn't get any so ended up with a classic Ceylon Green Tea (Rs. 350). I'd actually asked for the tea to go, but I ended up with a cup of boiling over-steeped tea that was too dark and bitter for my liking - or might have just been black tea sans sugar, I'm not sure.\nMy food experience was much better. I ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad (Rs. 700) and a Creamy Prawn Pasta (Rs. 880). The dish choices are fairly generic, and you can choose between vegetarian, prawn, and chicken in most cases.\nThe Caesar Salad was a hefty portion chock full of croutons, crispy lettuce, gently spiced grilled chicken, boiled eggs, all topped with parmesan. It came with a little bit of salad dressing on the side too, which was ever so slightly too sweet for me. Everything in the salad was very fresh, but the chicken was a bit too over-grilled for my liking.\nOk, so \"creamy\" doesn't really tell you much about the pasta except that they've put some cream in it. Despite the rather insipid name, the pasta itself was good. Al dente penne, with nicely flavoured lightly garlic and pepper cream sauce, and perfectly cooked prawns (lightly pink everywhere but not glazed or undercooked). It's a surprisingly big portion that I think is enough for two (but this might be because I'd just had half my massive milkshake).\nI was considering opting for one of their cakes that is generally on display, but my soul and waistline were still despairing over the Ferrero drama.\nThis is probably one of the largest coffee shops out there, with numerous and varied seating areas ranging from cosy armchairs for couples to large dining tables and sofas and chairs for bigger groups.\nI quite liked the display of their history and heritage, with photographs of the de Silva family dating back to 1936, their plantations, and a little display of their tea with explanations. This is particularly nice for people who like knowing where their cup comes from and the story behind it. There were some bags there as well, in case you want to buy some.\nThere's a big upstairs area and a rather nice outdoor seating bit too (lots of smokers there, so watch out). The private rooms are generally commandeered by cooing couples, so don't sit there unless you have a high PDA threshold.\nThe only issue with sitting upstairs or in one of the rooms is that the waitstaff can't see you directly so you'd have to come back to the cashier to make another order or to request anything.\nI find the service here is a huge hit or miss. The managers are generally very driven and efficient, but the waitstaff varies in enthusiasm. I was, however, incredibly pleasantly surprised by how quickly everything came out. My fancy milkshake was in my hand by the time I finished placing my meal order, and my dishes came out a mere 5-10 minutes after! To be fair, I got there at 12 noon, just before the crazy rush set in.\nI was also really keen to learn more about the company, their teas, and where they're sourced from so I could get a recommendation, but the staff didn't seem able to do so which was disappointing.\nTea Avenue's milkshakes are decadent piles of sugary happiness, and their food is generally always good. If you're looking for a straightforward dining experience or just a spot to nurse a coffee while you canoodle your boyfriend when your parents think you're studying, Tea Avenue is for you. Just be warned their prices have gone up a bit since our last review!\nOur latest look at Colombo 7's Tea Avenue\nTea Avenue is a very cosy stop on Barnes Place to have a good cup of flavoured tea and some bready goods. The prices are good and the ambience is suited for all kinds of meetups.\nTea Avenue is a very cosy stop on Barnes Place to have a good cup of flavoured tea and some bready goods.
