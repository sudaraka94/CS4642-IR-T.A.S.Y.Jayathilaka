  "reviews": "Started as a mansion during the colonial era, Nippon is one of the oldest landmarks of Colombo\u2019s history. Today it's a hotel with a restaurant (\n), cafe (\n) and a pub (The Cabinet).\u00a0They're\u00a0well-known\u00a0for their legendary mutton rolls, delicious chicken lamprais and reasonably priced cocktails and bites, among other things.\nThe Cabinet\u00a0is on tap from 10 am in the morning. The\u00a0alcohol is considerably cheap, and they've got a bunch\u00a0of fruit juices and cocktails for you to choose from.\nThe Nippon Green Apple (Rs. 499.69) from their signature cocktail range was pretty simple - Vodka and apple juice with a tinge of spiciness\u00a0that comes from the chili rimmed glass. In terms of presentation, it certainly has\u00a0room for improvement,\u00a0but the flavours worked well together.\nWe also tried a Margarita (Rs. 635.44), which was our favourite out of the two.\u00a0Involving the usual margarita mix, generous amount of Tequila and garnished with a lime\u00a0twist, it had all the elements of a good margarita in the right balance.\nThe Pepper Pork (Rs. 522.75) was excellent! It was piping hot, and had an incredible flavour. The meat was cooked to perfection with\u00a0a firm rind, and one of two fat bits that melt\u00a0in your mouth. Seasoned with black pepper,\u00a0crunchy green chilies and onions, this is a very generous portion of pork.\nThe Prawn Balls (Rs. 530.44) we tried at The Cabinet is probably one of the best ones out there. It's basically five big\u00a0spheres of mashed prawn, golden\u00a0batter fried\u00a0and tasted amazing, especially with the chili sauce that came with it. They were light, puffy and not crazy-oily, and we\u00a0devoured it within minutes.\nThe service\u00a0was pretty decent. The staff was polite, attentive and helpful. Our\u00a0food and drinks arrived within\u00a015 minutes.\nIn terms of the ambiance, it has a strong retro-themed vibe\u00a0going on, with wooden furniture and vintage posters hanging on the wall.\nAll in all, we really enjoyed our experience at The Cabinet. They've got some good cocktails, delicious bites and their prices are comparatively lower than the other pubs and bars around. Our total bill came to Rs.2870 including service charges and taxes, which is pretty cool considering that it is, in fact, a bar attached to a popular hotel in Colombo.\nThe Cabinet is the bar and lounge of historic Hotel Nippon.\n\n\u0d85\u0dc0\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4 \u0d91\u0d9a\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dba \u0d9c\u0dcf\u0dab\u0d9a\u0dca \u0d9c\u0dd2\u0dc4\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd\u0dad\u0dca  \u0dad\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dad\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dba\u0dc3\u0da7 \u0db1\u0ddc\u0d9c\u0dd2\u0dba \u0db1\u0dd2\u0db4\u0ddc\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc4\u0ddd\u0da7\u0dbd\u0dda \u0db6\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a.\n",
