  "reviews": "Momo's by Ruvi started its adventure with\u00a0great fanfare\u00a0less than a year ago and quickly became Colombo\u00a0institution for dumplings.\u00a0For those who missed the buzz, Momo's by Ruvi is\u00a0a tiny quaint restaurant\u00a0hidden in a narrow lane\u00a0opposite Majestic City\u00a0that exclusively sells\u00a0momos, these dumplings originated from Tibet.\nWe visited them during their opening week in April this year and were sold. We thought it was about time to\u00a0check if they were still living up to their reputation.\nFirst, you'll have to settle on the cooking style, as momos can either be steamed, shallow fried or wok fried. Second, you'll have to think about the filling: veggies, chicken, beef or prawn.\nOr, if you're hesitant or, like us,\u00a0want to try everything, go for a platter. The Meaty Fiesta (Rs. 1,250) enables you to choose 2 meats that will be cooked in all 3\u00a0ways, while the Platter (from Rs. 800 to Rs. 1,200 depending on the meat)\u00a0features a single type of meat prepared following the 3 possible methods. Note that a\u00a0platter should fill you up.\nNow that's the somehow confusing ordering part is done, let's enjoy the goodies!\nOn our last visit, we've tried most of the momos on the menu and\u00a0they were all equally delicious! The flimsy\u00a0dough held\u00a0generous and juicy fillings, mixes of veggies, meat if any and herbs. They were all\u00a0really delicate and so\u00a0flavoursome. Spot on!\nFillings are the same regardless of the cooking style. The steamed momos are the plain\u00a0and most delicate ones, the wok fried cooking brings some texture and interesting crunch\u00a0to the delicacy, while\u00a0the shallow fried version, coated in a delicious\u00a0spicy sauce, is the richest option.\nIt would be really hard to rank them. But for the sake of it and for you Yamu readers, we'll do it. And the winner\u00a0is...\u00a0Shallow Fried Chicken Momos, very closely followed by the Steamed Prawn Momos, and\u00a0all the other options.\nThere honestly wasn't a single thing we didn't like on our plates. The homemade chili & soy\u00a0and sambol sauces were also very nice and pleasantly accentuated the flavours of the dumplings.\nWe also gave a go to the only non-momo-ey item on the menu,\u00a0the Stir Fried Bok Choy (Rs. 230), served in soy sauce and sprinkled\u00a0with crunchy garlic and chili flakes. And we didn't regret it. It made a fresh and spicy add-on to our meal.\nMomo's by Ruvi is no fancy place and they don't try to look or act like one either, and we really like this attitude. They're here to make momos and they do it well. Full stop.\nThe restaurant can accommodate\u00a0about 15 to 20 diners max at a time in\u00a0one\u00a0cramped room. It's not very private as you can imagine and we wouldn't recommend it\u00a0to discuss confidential stuff or to declare your love to your crush. Unless you're very confident about your date or/and don't care about other people participating to it.\nWhile we aren't big fans of the quaint decoration, we acknowledge and appreciate the effort to make the place feel\u00a0warm and cosy. Plus, it's very neat and clean.\nWhile ordering was a bit of a confusing process (but maybe more on our side I have to admit), the rest flowed smoothly and the first platter arrived\u00a0pretty quickly. The person assuring the service on that day was welcoming and discreet.\nWe're glad to confirm that Momo's by Ruvi is living up to the hype. Dumpling lovers, you're in for a treat! And for a fair price. Dumpling haters, go on your way, this place isn't for you!\nA cosy little place overflowing with momos and quirky decoration.\nAuthentic and affordable food, complete with a chef who knows his dishes.\n",
