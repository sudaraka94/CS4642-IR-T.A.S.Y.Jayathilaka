  "reviews": "The Fab has been a trusted source of affordable cakes and short-eats for the past 36 years. I've long thought of it as that reliable stop for that box of cake you think of getting when you're heading to a friend's or relative's house. We dropped by this popular Colpetty bakery after ages, to try a little bit of everything - no regrets, they're still good.\nI like how our oldest bakeries have grown, literally. Green Cabin's restaurant-like Pagoda Tea Rooms in Fort and Sponge's comfy sofa-laden lobby are examples, and though The Fab isn't as spacious as they are it's still bigger than average; a very neat, sunlit place to sit down for a tasty meal. This is one of the city's most popular bakeries though, so it can get very crowded especially at lunch, in which case you're going to have to elbow a few to get the attention of the guy behind the counter. Generally though, the staff seems efficient.\nThere's a good variety of short-eats here - pastries, rolls, pies, and a healthy amount of vegetarian options - though they're fast moving, so I'd suggest you go early morning as with other quality bakeries like Sponge and Tasty. We got a fish pie and mutton pie - alas, I was deprived of my mutton pie since the busy blokes forgot to pack that bit in my takeaway bag - but the fish pie was really, really good. Plenty of savoury, saucy stuffing in a good amount of soft pastry for just 70 bucks.\nWe're always surprised when over-the-counter type bakeries have good sweet stuff, they honestly rarely ever put much effort into it. But the chocolate chip cookies, chocolate brownie and eclairs were quite good - nothing fantastic but if I was in the mood for a quick, affordable, tasty bite to satisfy my sweet-tooth cravings, I'd bet on the stuff here. The cookies were especially crisp and sugary.\nIt is, however, the cake, that really brings people to The Fab. Sure, you've got the English Cake Company and Yumi Cake who have mastered the art of amazing gourmet takeaway-cake, but when you just don't have the cash for that and want to casually grab a party order, the cake here is always reliable. Besides their famed chocolate cake and other full ones, they also have a few tasty little bites - like our chocolate chip cupcake and our Oreo and cheese slice. Both were rich, creamy, and soft - none of that dry ribbon cake feel of much of the city's failed bakeries. We especially appreciated the warm surprise of gooey chocolate at the centre of the cupcake.\nWe were there during lunch so we tried the rice and curry - it's a nice big packet of fresh samba rice with potato, brinjal, beans, some kadala dhal and a generous portion of flavoursome, ever so slightly roasted chicken. It's a good lunch, with a pleasant tinge of sweetness from the bit of sweet cucumber and pineapple salad. We fondly remember The Fab though, for its lamprais, which came in 1st Place among the contenders of\nso if you're looking for a solid lamprais, this is the place.\nThe Fab is one of the good ones. If you're up for a simple, quality session of lunch or snacking and you're not in the mood to splurge, these guys are a very convenient option.\nAh, Fab.
