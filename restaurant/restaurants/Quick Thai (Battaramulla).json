  "reviews": "Quick Thai has been around for as long as I can remember and they're one of the few places that serve Thai cuisine that's value for your money. We dropped in for a late lunch and walked out with our tummies full and hearts contented.\nIt's located on Pannipitiya Road, between Pizza Hut and HSBC. In the earlier days, when Battaramulla didn't have a lot of places like\n,\nor\n, Quick Thai is where people went to have a decent meal. We're happy to say that they have managed to keep the quality of their food pretty consistent.\nThe Prawn Pad Thai Noodles (Rs. 770) we got was one of the best I have tried. The refined Thai flavours along with perfectly cooked prawns, peanuts and the lemongrass added up\u00a0to spicy and filling noodles with a tinge of sweetness.\nThe Chicken with Cashew Nuts (Rs. 705) was amazing! There were lots of pieces of fried chicken soaked in a succulent and spicy sauce with cashews and sauteed veggies. The chicken was flavourful with a hint of sweetness which balanced out the spiciness of the sauce.\nIf I see Hot Butter Mushroom (Rs. 450) on the menu, I get it. This was a bit sweeter than the ones I have had before but I can't say I didn't like it. It was perfectly on par with the rest of the dishes. It was on the menu as an appetizer but it could just as easily be a side dish because of the huge portion we received. The mushrooms were crispy and crunchy, with perfect seasoning. I highly recommend all you vegetarians give it a go.\nUnfortunately, they didn't have any of the desserts I was looking forward to, like the Sticky Rice with Mango or the Banana Fritters with Ice Cream.\nThe Pineapple Juice (Rs. 395) we got was quite pricey for fruit juice, especially since the ratio was off. Halfway through the drink, I had to take the straw out and drink straight from the glass because it was just blended pineapple and no water. It was alright but I don't see myself ordering it again.\nHere's the thing. Before I went there I checked their Facebook reviews and almost all of them had said that their service is really bad. However, we didn't experience anything abysmally terrible. The staff was all smiles and brought our food to the table within 10-15 minutes. Although I do have to mention that they were quite impatient and didn't really give us time to decide on our order. It's distracting when the waiter keeps inching towards our table every 5 seconds.\nI really appreciate the themed ambience they have going on. With wooden tables and benches along with the\u00a0woven table mats it really gives the feel of a Thai restaurant. They also have\u00a0seating upstairs with cushioned furniture so if your butt hurts from sitting on wood, you can sit there. The place could use a bit of brightening because unless you're sitting near the window you won't get much lighting.\nQuick Thai was a quality experience with delicious food. The prices are a tad pricey but you\nhave a filling meal for about Rs. 1500 per head, which is alright considering you get to taste\u00a0Thai cuisine in Colombo.\nServing authentic Thai with delicious, filling meals.\nQuick Thai serves up a range of affordable Thai dishes that are low on refinement, yet big on taste, from its modest, but elegant Pelawatta premises.\n\n\u0d9a\u0ddc\u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db8 \u0dc0\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dad\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dad\u0dcf\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0d9c\u0dd0\u0db1 \u0d85\u0db4\u0dda \u0dad\u0dd2\u0db6\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4 \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3 \u0d89\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd9\u0dc2\u0db1\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a, \u0db8\u0dd9\u0daf\u0dcf \u0dc3\u0dd0\u0dbb\u0dda \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dad\u0dbb\u0db8\u0d9a\u0dca \u0d85\u0da9\u0dd4 \u0dc0\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dcf \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dbd\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0d85\u0db4\u0dda \u0dc4\u0dd0\u0d9f\u0dd3\u0db8 \u0db1\u0db8\u0dca.\n\n\u0dc4\u0dd0\u0db6\u0dd0\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0dba\u0dcf\u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dad\u0dcf\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0d85\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc4\u0dbd\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0db8 \u0db4\u200d\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0db8\u0dcf\u0dab\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0db1\u0db8\u0dca \u0da7\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dbd\u0ddc\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dba\u0dd2. \u0d85\u0db4\u0dd2 \u0daf\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0da7\u0dad\u0dca \u0d92\u0d9a \u0dad\u0dda\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dda \u0db6\u0da9 \u0db4\u0dd0\u0dbd\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0d89\u0dc0\u0dbb \u0d8b\u0db1\u0dcf\u0da7 \u0db4\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dd9\u0dad\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd2\u0d9f\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dd9 \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0db8 \u0da7\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca \u0d89\u0dad\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd4 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dc0 \u0daf\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dca\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0db8.\n",
