  "reviews": "Isso broke into the scene to some rave reviews from both YAMU and the general public. Now, a couple of months down the line, we headed back to see if they\u2019ve kept up their lofty standards.\nIsso\u2019s name doesn\u2019t really leave much to the imagination with their prawn-centric theme. We loved their stuff when we dropped in for our first look back in April, but we\u2019re taking a closer look with this first review. They\u2019re also one of the only restaurants in Colombo that focuses on one core ingredient in all their dishes. We really appreciate the fact that they\u2019ve kept their menu concise with a few clever and popular prawn variations.\nThe prices of the dishes depend on the size of the prawns with the large at Rs. 900, XL at Rs. 1100 and XXL at Rs. 1300, though we feel that the large is the sweet spot. They have a three step ordering system where you initially choose the prawn size, followed by the preparation and the type of carb. It\u2019s simple and uncomplicated which is quite rare nowadays.\nFor the sake of comparison, we got the Northern Twist again (because we tried it during our first look) and it was just as good. This is Isso\u2019s take on a Jaffna style prawn curry and it\u2019s safe to say they do it justice. This had plenty of flavours going on with an emphasis on the tamarind and a peppery hit at the end.\nWe paired it with their sweet potato fries which we\u2019d say is the best of their carb choices. These were chunky and crispy with a nice contrast of saltiness and a hint of sweetness. It\u2019s also one of the healthier carbs around so you can actually enjoy this without feeling too guilty.\nThe Local Favourite a.k.a hot butter prawns is also a great reincarnation\u00a0of the classic HBC preparation. It\u2019s got this beautifully vibrant orange batter tossed in a good amount of chilli, peppers, capsicums and onions. The prawns were cooked just right with that heat from that extra chilli coming through well and a nice crunch from the\u00a0thin batter. We had this with cous cous which was a tad dry, but we can see it working better with their red curry.\nIsso recently introduced their Prawn Lampais (Rs. 900) which is currently only available on weekends. We\u2019ve tried it a couple of times now and it\u2019s the only thing we weren\u2019t really impressed with. It\u2019s not terrible by any means, but at Rs. 900 this comes with a less prawns than their regular stuff and it's just not worth it. The rice itself was too milky, with crucial elements like the blachan replaced by their chilli sambol which just doesn\u2019t give that same flavour. The prawns again were very light on the spices, so the flavour was very similar to that of the rice.\nIsso has taken up the former space of the cakery on Suleiman Terrace, which makes it a very accessible location in central Colombo.\u00a0They\u2019ve got a very simple set up which caters\u00a0mostly towards take-out orders, but they do have a dine-in space for around fifteen.\nThe interaction with the staff is minimal since it\u2019s quite a quick process, but they\u2019re quite friendly so no complaints on that end. They also serve up all their stuff in plastic boxes with compartments which can be super useful later.\nIsso\u2019s staples have impressed enough to score 5/5 despite the somewhat lacklustre lamprais, which really says a lot about how impressive their stuff is. As far as prawns in Colombo are concerned, Isso is as good as it gets.\nIsso deals with isso. Curried isso, tossed isso, isso with roast paan, and isso with bathala chips. Yes.\nIsso's pretty self-explanatory \u2014 it derives its name from the prawn, they serve prawn, they are prawn.\n\n\u0d89\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0ddd \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0ddd \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0db8 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0d91\u0d9a \u0db8 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1 \u0db8\u0dda\u0d9a \u0dad\u0db8\u0dba\u0dd2.\n\n\u0db8\u0db8 \u0dc4\u0dd2\u0dad\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dd9 \u0d89\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0ddd \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda \u0dbd\u0d82\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0dda \u0d9c\u0ddc\u0da9\u0daf\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dd9\u0d9a\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dda \u0d86\u0dc3\u0db8 \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0db8\u0d9a\u0dca. \u0d89\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0ddd \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1 \u0dc0\u0da0\u0db1\u0dd9 \u0d87\u0dc4\u0dd4\u0dab \u0d9c\u0db8\u0db1\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dd4 \u0dc4\u0dd0\u0daf\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0dba\u0dcf\u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0ddd \u0d9c\u0ddc\u0da9\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db8\u0da7 \u0d89\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf.\n",
