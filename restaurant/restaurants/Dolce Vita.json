  "reviews": "I first thought Negombo was called Little Rome because of the amount of Italian restaurants in\u00a0town.\u00a0The nickname\u00a0apparently comes from the considerable number of Roman Catholic churches you can find in the city,\u00a0ancient remnants from the Portuguese era still heavily frequented by the large Catholic population of the area.\nMore into food than religious heritage, I preferred to stick to my first thought and to visit Dolce Vita, this homely beachside restaurant away from the buzz of Poruthota Road.\nA red Vespa would have given a more authentic look\u00a0to the entrance but I don't think the\u00a0yellow scooter was part of the scenery\u00a0anyway.\nWe purposely ignored the sandwiches, crepes, burgers, etc, to focus on\u00a0Italian staples: pizzas and pasta. And gelato (only because they're homemade).\nThe\u00a0sea breeze and relaxing sound of the waves crashing on the beach nearby\u00a0probably influenced our first pick:\u00a0the Seafood Tagliatelle (Rs. 900). The al dente pasta\u00a0came with lots of fresh prawns and cuttlefish in a deliciously oily, garlicky and spicy sauce. This simple dish was brilliantly executed. A\u00a0lot of flavours were going on: the seafood, the garlic, the chili, the herbs, the olive oil.\u00a0And the cooking of the pastas was spot on! Kudos for that! The only miss was the cuttlefish that was a bit chewy.\nDolce Vita makes\u00a0Neapolitan-style pizzas, easily identifiable with their\u00a0rather thick bready crusts.\u00a0The dough was perfectly cooked: crusty on the inside and soft in the inside. Yum! It lacked bit of salt\u00a0but\u00a0the saltiness of the tomato sauce and other ingredients compensated.\nThe Quattro Stagioni (Rs. 1,000) immediately delighted us with the way the main ingredients (black olives, ham and\u00a0artichokes) were aesthetically arranged on the pizza. Taste-wise\u00a0we were also pleased. From the tomato sauce to the crust, cheese, olives or ham,\u00a0all components were of high quality.\nThe Salami Pizza (Rs. 1,100),\u00a0simple and efficient, was equally good. The subtlety spiced\u00a0salami made\u00a0us happy.\nFinally, we couldn't resist the gelato call, especially after reading on the menu that they're homemade. Choice was limited to 6 flavours on that day, which made our life way easier. We tried half of the offer: Chocolate, Vanilla and Coconut (Rs. 250 a scoop). And the winner was coconut! Taste and texture were both on point. It was creamy and the coconut flavour was subtle and not overpowering. The 2 others unfortunately tasted rather\u00a0synthetic and we found some\u00a0ice crystals in the vanilla ice cream, which is not a nice find.\nRestaurant names don't always make sense but in this case, Dolce Vita (sweet life) perfectly suits the\u00a0place. It's hard to describe why but it feels good to be there.\u00a0Time seems to slow down as soon as you enter.\u00a0Is it because of the retro style that makes Dolce Vita look\u00a0like an old cafe from a secluded village in Europe? Is it the proximity with the beach? Or is it the cheesy Italian music in the background? Probably not this last guess. Anyway, Dolce Vita is a chilled spot with good vibes. You won't want to leave.\nThe service is nice and efficient, really nothing to complaint about.\nDolce Vita is a very homely and affordable place to hang out with friends, good Italian food and a great view of the Negombo Beach. We\u00a0strongly recommend when passing through Negombo if like us\u00a0you're more into Italian food than Roman Catholic churches.\nUnpretentious Italian restaurant on Negombo Beach serving honest pizzas, pastas, gelato and more.\nThe food is good value for money, and it comes in generous portions. More importantly, they don't disappoint.\n",
